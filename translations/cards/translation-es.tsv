1	es	Mercado Negro	Acción		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Revela las 3 cartas superiores del mazo del Mercado Negro. Puedes comprar una de ellas inmediatamente. Coloca las cartas no compradas en la parte de abajo del mazo en cualquier orden.<br/><br/><i>(Antes de comenzar el juego, forma un mazo del Mercado Negro con una copia de cada carta de reino que no esté en el suministro)</i>	 Black Market allows you to Buy a card during the Action phase. You can use coins provided by other Action cards played earlier in the Action phase and you can also play Treasure cards from your hand to pay the cost of the bought card. The Treasure cards are played to the table in your play area, just as you would during the Buy phase. You may play more Treasure cards than are required for the purchase; the extra coins from Action cards and Treasure cards are available to use during your Buy phase. You may even play Treasure cards without Buying a card. You may not reuse coins already spent during a turn. A card bought during the Action phase does not count as a card bought in your Buy phase, so you do not need an action card giving you +1 Buy to still buy a card during your normal Buy phase. The Black Market deck, created before game start, is made up of Kingdom cards that are not in the Supply of the current game. The players should agree before the game which cards will be used to create the Black Market deck (for example, you could agree to use one of every Kingdom card you own that is not a part of the Supply). It is recommended that the Black Market deck contain at least 15 Kingdom cards, with no duplicates. All players can see which cards are placed in the Black Market deck before the game begins, at which point the deck is shuffled. This deck is not a Supply pile and if it is emptied, it does not count towards the end game conditions. If you play Black Market and the Black Market deck is empty, you cannot buy a card but you still get +2 Coins. If you play Black Market and choose not to buy one of the three cards from the Black Market deck, you still get +2 Coins.
2	es	Alijo	Tesoro		<big><c>2</c></big><hr/>Al barajar, puedes colocar esta carta en cualquier posición de tu mazo..	 Stash is a Treasure that produces 2 coins when played, like Silver. Whenever you shuffle your deck, you can choose where in your deck each copy of Stash that you have goes. You can't look at the fronts of the other cards in your deck to see where to put it; Stash itself has a different card back, so that's how you'll know where it is. If you have multiple copies of Stash, you can clump them together or spread them out or whatever you want. Since Stash has a different card back, you will also know if it's in a player's hand, or set aside for someone's Haven (from Seaside), and so on.
3	es	Enviado	Acción		Revela las 5 cartas superiores de tu mazo. El jugador de tu izquierda elige una para que la descartes. Quédate las restantes.	 If you do not have 5 cards in your deck, reveal as many as you can and shuffle your discard pile to reveal the rest. The player to your left then chooses one of the revealed cards for you to discard and then you draw the rest. If you do not have enough cards left to reveal 5 cards, even after shuffling, reveal as many as you can. The opponent to your left still discards one card before you draw the rest.
4	es	Pueblo Amurallado	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones</b><hr/>Al comienzo de tu fase de Mantenimiento, si sólo tienes en juego esta carta y, como máximo, otra otra carta de Acción, puedes ponder el Pueblo Amurallado encima de tu mazo.	 When you play this, you draw a card and can play two more Actions this turn. At the start of your Clean-up phase, before discarding anything and before drawing for next turn, if you have a Walled Village in play and no more than two Action cards in play (counting the Walled Village), you may put the Walled Village on top of your deck. If the only cards you have in play are two Walled Villages, you may put either or both of them on top of your deck. Walled Village has to be in play to be put on top of your deck. Walled Village only checks how many Action cards are in play when its ability resolves; Action cards you played earlier this turn but which are no longer in play (such as Feast from Dominion) are not counted, while Action cards still in play from previous turns (duration cards from Dominion: Seaside) are counted, as are Action cards that are in play now but may leave play after resolving Walled Village (such as Treasury from Dominion: Seaside).
5	en	Governor	Acción		<b>+1 Action</b><br/><br/>Choose one: you get the version in parenthesis:<br/>Each player gets +1 (+3) Cards; or each player gains a Silver (Gold); or each player may trash a card from his hand and gain a card costing exactly <c>1</c> (<c>2</c>) more.	You always get +1 Action. Then you either 1) draw three cards and each other player draws a card; 2) gain a Gold and each other player gains a Silver; 3) may trash a card from your hand and gain a card costing exactly 2 Coins more and each other player may trash a card from his hand and gain a card costing exactly 1 Coin more. Go in turn order, starting with yourself; this may matter if piles are low. The gained cards come from the Supply and are put into discard piles; if there are none left, those cards are not gained. For example if you choose the second option and there is only one Silver in the Supply, the player to your left gets it and no-one else gets one. For the third option, you only gain a card if you trashed a card, and only if there is a card available in the Supply with the exact cost required. If you do trash a card, you must gain a card if you can. You cannot trash a Governor you played to itself, as it is no longer in your hand when you play it (though you can trash another copy of Governor from your hand).
6	es	Sótano	Acción		<b>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Descarta las cartas que quieras.<br/>Roba +1 Carta por cada carta descartada.	No puedes descartarte del Sótano, puesto que no se encuentra ya en tu mano cuando resuelves la Acción. Eliges las Cartas que quieres y las descartas de una vez. Sólo puedes robar las Cartas después de que te hayas descartado. Si tuvieras que barajar tu Pila de Descartes para robar, las Cartas descartadas también serán barajadas en el nuevo Mazo.
7	es	Capilla	Acción		Elimina hasta 4 cartas de tu mano.	No puedes eliminar la Carta de Capilla, puesto que no se encuentra en tu mano cuando resuelves la Acción. Sí podrías eliminar otra Carta de Capilla que pudieras tener en tu mano.
8	es	Foso	Acción Reacción		<b>+2 Cartas</b><hr/>Cuando otro jugador juegue una carta de Ataque, puedes enseñar esta carta de tu mano. Si lo haces, el Ataque no te afecta.	Una Carta de Ataque es la que pone "Acción - Ataque" en la línea inferior. Cuando alguien juegue una, puedes enseñar una Carta de Foso que tengas en la mano (y devolverla a tu mano) para que el Ataque no te afecte: no recibes Maldición de una Bruja, no tienes que revelar una Carta a un Espía, etc. El Foso no anula los efectos en los demás jugadores, ni anula la Carta de Ataque (y así, el jugador que jugó la Bruja puede robar 2 Cartas). El Foso, jugado como una Acción durante tu Turno, te permite robar 2 Cartas de tu Mazo.
9	es	Canciller	Acción		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Puedes poner inmediatamente tu mazo en tu pila de descartes.	Debes resolver el Canciller (y decidir si descartas o no todo tu Mazo) antes de hacer nada más en tu Turno (como decidir lo que vas a comprar o jugar otra Carta de Acción). Tampoco podrás mirar el Mazo cuando lo descartes.
10	es	Aldea	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones</b>	Si pones en juego varias Aldeas, lleva bien la cuenta de las Acciones que te quedan por realizar. Un truco que suele funcionar consiste en decir en voz alta las Acciones que aún te faltan.
11	es	Leñadores	Acción		<b>+1 Compra<br/>+<c>2</c></b>	Durante tu Fase de Compra, añades 2 monedas al valor total de las Cartas de Tesoro que juegues y, además, podrás comprar una Carta más del Suministro.
12	es	Taller	Acción		Gana una carta que tenga un coste máximo de <c>4</c>.	La Carta que ganas se pone en tu Pila de Descartes. Tiene que ser una Carta del Suministro. No puedes utilizar monedas procedentes de Cartas de Tesoro o de Acciones previas para incrementar el coste de la Carta ganada.
13	es	Burócrata	Acción Ataque		Ganas una carta de Plata y la colocas encima de tu mazo.<br/>Los demás jugadores tienen que enseñar una carta de Victoria y ponerla encima de su mazo (o mostrar toda su mano si no tienen cartas de Victoria).	Si no queda ninguna Carta en tu Mazo cuando juegas el Burócrata, la Carta de Plata que ganas es convertirá en la única Carta de tu Mazo. Del mismo modo, si un jugador no tiene Cartas en su Mazo, la Carta de Victoria que debe poner encima se convertirá en la única Carta de dicho Mazo.
14	es	Banquete	Acción		Elimina esta carta.<br/>Gana una carta con un coste máximo de <c>5</c>	La Carta ganada va a tu Pila de Descartes y debe ser una Carta del Suministro. No puedes utilizar monedas de Tesoros o Acciones previas (como el Mercado) para incrementar el coste de la Carta que ganas. Si usas el Salón del Trono con un Banquete, ganarás 2 Cartas, aunque solamente eliminarás una Carta de Banquete.
15	es	Jardines	Victoria		Consigue <vp>1</vp> por cada 10 cartas que tengas en tu mazo (redondeado hacia abajo).	Esta Carta de Reino es una Carta de Victoria, y no de Acción. No sirve para nada hasta el final de la partida, donde concederá 1 Punto de Victoria por cada 10 Cartas que haya en tu Mazo (contando todas tus Cartas y redondeando hacia abajo). Durante la preparación del juego, habrá que colocar 12 Cartas de Jardines en el Suministro para una partida de 3-4 jugadores y sólo 8 Cartas en el Suministro para una partida con 2 jugadores.
16	es	Milicia	Acción Ataque		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Los demás jugadores se descartan hasta quedarse con 3 cartas en la mano.	Los jugadores atacados deben descartarse de Cartas de su mano hasta quedarse únicamente con 3 Cartas. Los jugadores que tengan 3 Cartas o menos en su mano al ponerse en juego la Milicia no tendrán que descartarse de ninguna.
17	es	Prestamista	Acción		Elimina una carta de Cobre de tu mano.<br/>Si lo haces, +<c>3</c>.	Si no tienes en tu mano una Carta de Cobre para eliminar, tampoco consigues las 3 monedas para gastar en tu Fase de Compra.
18	es	Remodelar	Acción		Elimina una carta de tu mano.<br/>Gana una carta que cueste hasta <c>2</c> más que la carta eliminada.	No puedes eliminar la Carta Remodelar, puesto que no se encuentra en tu mano cuando resuelves la Acción, aunque sí podrías eliminar otra Carta Remodelar que tuvieras en la mano. Si no puedes eliminar una Carta, tampoco ganas la Carta que te concede. La Carta ganada va a la Pila de Descartes y sólo puede ser una Carta del Suministro que cueste hasta 2 monedas más que la Carta eliminada. No puedes utilizar monedas procedentes de Tesoros o Acciones previas para incrementar el coste de la Carta ganada. Puedes eliminar una Carta para ganar la misma Carta.
19	es	Herrería	Acción		<b>+3 Cartas</b>	Robas 3 Cartas de tu Mazo.
20	es	Espía	Acción Ataque		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (incluso tú) revela la carta superior de su mazo y tú decides si la descarta o la devuelve a su sitio.	El Espía hace que todos los jugadores (hasta el que juega la Carta) revelen la Carta superior de su Mazo. Pero antes de hacerlo, debes robar la Carta que te otorga el Espía. Los jugadores que no tengan Cartas en su Mazo tendrán que barajar su Pila de Descartes para tener alguna Carta que revelar. Si alguien siguiera sin Cartas, no tendría que revelar ninguna. Si los jugadores deciden hacerlo en orden, primero revelas tú la Carta y luego se sigue en sentido horario. Las Cartas reveladas que no se descarten, se devuelven a la parte superior de los Mazos de los jugadores.
21	es	Ladrón	Acción Ataque		Cada jugador (menos tú) revela las 2 cartas superiores de su mazo y elimina 1 carta de Tesoro entre las reveladas (a elección tuya).<br/>Puedes ganar los Tesoros eliminados que quieras. Las demás cartas reveladas se descartan.	Un jugador que sólo tenga una Carta en su Mazo, revela esa carta, baraja la Pila de Descartes (sin incluir la Carta revelada) para formar un nuevo Mazo, y revela la otra Carta. Si no tuviera Cartas suficientes después de barajar, sólo tendrá que revelar una Carta. Cada jugador elimina la Carta de Tesoro que tú decidas, ganando, además, los Tesoros eliminados en este Turno que te interesen. Los Tesoros que hayas robado van a tu Pila de Descartes; el resto son eliminados.
22	es	Salón del trono	Acción		Elige una carta de Acción de tu mano. Juégala 2 veces.	Escoges una Carta de Acción de tu mano, la juegas, y la vuelves a jugar. El segundo uso de la Carta de Acción no consume ninguna Acción extra que pudieras tener. Debes resolver completamente la Acción la primera vez antes de hacerlo la segunda. Puedes jugar un Salón del Trono sobre otro para jugar una Acción y hacerla dos veces, y para jugar otra Acción y hacerla dos veces (no para jugar la misma Acción cuatro veces). Si la juegas con una Carta que te da +1 Acción (un Mercado), terminarás con +2 Acciones. No puedes jugar otra Acción en medio de la Acción que se repite gracias a un Salón del Trono.
23	es	Sala del consejo	Acción		<b>+4 Cartas<br/>+1 Compra</b><br/><br/>Los demás jugadores roban una carta cada uno.	Los demás jugadores tienen que robar 1 Carta de su Mazo, quieran o no. Si fuera necesario, tendrán que barajar su Pila de Descartes para formar un nuevo Mazo.
24	es	Festival	Acción		<b>+2 Acciones<br/>+1 Compra<br/>+<c>2</c></b>	Si estás jugando varias Cartas de Festival, lleva bien la cuenta de las Acciones que te faltan. Suele funcionar muy bien ir diciendo en voz alta las Acciones que restantes.
25	es	Laboratorio	Acción		<b>+2 Cartas<br/>+1 Acción</b>	Robas 2 Cartas de tu Mazo. Y puedes jugar otra Carta de Acción durante tu Fase de Acción.
26	es	Biblioteca	Acción		Roba cartas de una en una hasta tener 7 cartas en la mano. Puedes ir apartando las cartas de Acción que vayas sacando.<br/>Cuando termines, descarta las cartas que hayas apartado.	Si tienes que barajar en medio de la Acción, hazlo, pero sin barajar las Cartas que hayas apartado, puesto que estas Cartas no irán a la Pila de Descartes hasta que hayas terminado de robar Cartas. Si se terminan las Cartas después de barajar, sólo conseguirás las Cartas disponibles. No estás obligado a apartar las Acciones (tú decides si apartas la Acción o te la quedas). Si ya tienes 7 Cartas en la mano (o más) después de jugar la Biblioteca, no podrás robar Cartas.
27	es	Mercado	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción<br/>+1 Compra<br/>+<c>1</c></b>	Robas 1 Carta. Puedes jugar otra Carta de Acción durante tu Fase de Acción. En tu Fase de Compra, puedes comprar una Carta adicional del Suministro, añadiendo 1 moneda al valor total de las Cartas de Tesoro que juegues.
28	es	Mina	Acción		Elimina una carta de Tesoro de tu mano. Gana una carta de Tesoro que cueste hasta <c>3</c> más.<br/>La carta ganada va directamente a tu mano.	Generalmente, eliminarás una Carta de Cobre para ganar una de Plata, o eliminarás una de Plata para ganar una de Oro. Aunque también podrías eliminar un Tesoro para ganar el mismo Tesoro o uno de menor valor. La Carta ganada va a tu mano, con lo que podrás gastarla en el mismo Turno. Si no tienes una Carta de Tesoro en tu mano para eliminar, tampoco ganas nada.
29	es	Bruja	Acción Ataque		<b>+2 Cartas</b><br/><br/>Cada uno de los demás jugadores gana una carta de Maldición.	Si no hubiera suficientes Maldiciones para repartir a los jugadores, repartes las que haya empezando por el jugador siguiente a ti. Si no queda ninguna Maldición cuando juegas la Bruja, todavía puedes robar 2 Cartas. El jugador que recibe una Maldición debe colocar la Carta en su Pila de Descartes.
30	es	Aventurero	Acción		Levanta cartas de tu mazo hasta que descubras 2 Cartas de Tesoro.<br/>Coloca los Tesoros en tu mano y descarta las demás cartas.	Si tienes que barajar en medio de la Acción, hazlo, pero no barajes las Cartas que hayas revelado, puesto que estas Cartas no irán a la Pila de Descartes hasta que hayas terminado de revelar Cartas. Si se terminan las Cartas después de barajar y sólo ha salido un Tesoro, ese Tesoro será todo lo que consigas.
31	es	Herbalista	Acción		<b>+1 Compra<br/>+<c>1</c></b><hr/>Cuando lo descartes, puedes poner encima de tu mazo una carta de Tesoro que esté en juego.	 You get an extra coin to spend this turn, and may buy an additional card in your Buy phase. When you discard this from play (usually during Clean-up), you may choose a Treasure card you have in play, and put that card on your deck. If you have no cards in your deck, that Treasure will become the only card in your deck. You choose what order to discard cards during Clean-up; so, for example, if you have Herbalist, Potion, and Alchemist in play, you could choose to discard Alchemist first, putting it on top of your deck, then discard Herbalist, and put Potion on top of your deck. If you have multiple Herbalists in play, each one will let you put another Treasure from play onto your deck.
32	es	Aprendiz	Acción		<b>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Elimina una carta de tu mano.<br/><b>+1 Carta</b> por cada <c/> que cueste y<br/><b>+2 Cartas</b> si incluye una <pot/> en su coste.	 If you do not have any cards left in hand to trash, you do not draw any cards. If you trash a card costing 0 coins, such as Curse or Copper, you do not draw any cards. Otherwise you draw a card per Coin the card you trashed cost, and another two cards if it had Potion in its cost. For example, if you trash a Golem, which costs 4 Coins and 1 Potion, you draw 6 cards.
33	es	Transmutar	Acción		Elimina una carta de tu mano.<br/>Si se trata de una carta...<br/>de <b>Acción</b>, gana una carta de <b>Ducado</b>;<br/>de <b>Tesoro</b>, gana una carta <b>Transmutar</b>;<br/>de <b>Victoria</b>, gana una carta de <b>Oro</b>.	 If you have no cards left in hand to trash, you do not get anything. If you trash a Curse to this, you do not get anything - Curse is not an Action card or Victory card or Treasure card. If you trash a card with more than one type, you get each applicable thing. For example, if you trash an Action-Victory card (such as Nobles, from Intrigue), you gain both a Duchy and a Gold. Gained cards come from the Supply and go to your discard pile. If there are no appropriate cards left to gain, you don't gain those cards.
34	es	Viñedo	Victoria		Consigue <vp>1</vp> por cada 3 cartas de Acción que tengas en tu mazo al final de la partida (redondeando hacia abajo).	 This Kingdom card is a Victory card, not an Action card. It does nothing until the end of the game, when it is worth 1 victory point per 3 Action cards in your Deck (counting all of your cards - your Discard pile and hand are part of your Deck at that point). Round down; if you have 11 Action cards, Vineyard is worth 3 victory points. During set-up, put all 12 Vineyards in the Supply for a game with 3 or more players, but only 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action, are Actions and so are counted by Vineyard.
35	es	Boticario	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Revela las 4 cartas superiores de tu mazo. Las cartas reveladas de Cobre y de Poción van a tu mano y las demás cartas reveladas vuelve a la parte superior de tu mazo, en el orden que quieras.	 You draw a card first. Then reveal the top four cards, put the Coppers and Potions into your hand, and put the rest back on top of your deck. If there aren't four cards left in your deck, reveal what you can and shuffle to get the rest. If there still aren't enough cards, just reveal what there is. Any cards that are not Copper and are not Potion go back on top of your deck in an order your choose. You cannot choose not to take all of the Coppers and Potions. If after revealing four cards there are no cards left in your deck, the cards you put back will become the only cards in your deck.
36	es	Hidromancia	Acción Ataque		<b>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (incluso tú) revela la carta superior de su mazo, para descartarla o ponerla de nuevo encima del mazo, lo que tú decidas. A continuación, levanta cartas de tu mazo hasta que reveles una carta que no sea de Acción. Pon todas las cartas reveladas en tu mano.	 First you reveal the top card of each player's deck, and either have them discard it or have them put it back. After you finish making those decisions, reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal a card that isn't an Action card. If you run out of cards without revealing an Action card, shuffle your discard pile and keep going. If you have no discard pile left either, stop there. Put all of the revealed Action cards into your hand, plus that first non-Action you revealed. If the very first card you revealed was not an Action, that card goes into your hand. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action, are Actions. The only cards that go into your hand are the ones revealed as part of the revealing cards until finding a non-Action; you do not get discarded cards from the first part of what Scrying Pool did, or cards from other players' decks.
37	es	Universidad	Acción		<b>+2 Acciones</b><br/><br/>Puedes ganar una carta de Acción que tenga un coste máximo de <c>5</c>.	 Gaining an Action card is optional. If you choose to gain one, it comes from the Supply, must cost no more than 5 coins, and goes to your discard pile. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action, are Actions and can be gained this way. Cards with Potion in their cost can't be gained by this.
38	es	Alquimista	Acción		<b>+2 Cartas<br/>+1 Acción</b><hr/>Cuando lo descartes, si tienes alguna Poción en juego, puedes poner esta carta encima de tu mazo.	 When you play this, you draw two cards and may play an additional Action card this turn. In the Clean-up Phase, when you discard this, if you have at least one Potion card in play, you may put Alchemist on top of your deck. This is optional and happens before drawing your new hand. If you have no cards in your deck when you do this, Alchemist becomes the only card in your deck. If you have multiple Alchemists and a Potion, you can put any or all of the Alchemists on top of your deck. You don't have to have used the Potion to buy anything, you only need to have played it.
39	es	Familiar	Acción Ataque	Requiere: Maldición	<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) gana una carta de Maldición.	 If there aren't enough Curses left to go around when you play Familiar, you deal them out in turn order, starting with the player to your left. If you play Familiar with no Curses remaining, you will still get +1 Card and +1 Action. A player gaining a Curse puts it face-up into his Discard pile.
40	es	Piedra Filosofal	Tesoro		Cuando la pongas en juego, cuenta las cartas que hay en tu mazo y en tu pila de descartes.<br/>+<c>1</c> por cada 5 cartas que tengas en total (redondeando hacia abajo).	 This is a Treasure card. It is a Kingdom card; it will only be in games where it is randomly dealt out as one of the 10 Kingdom cards, or otherwise selected to be one of them. It is played during your Buy phase, like other Treasure cards. When you play it, count the number of cards in your deck and discard pile combined, divide by 5, and round down. That is how many coins this produces for you. Once played, the amount of coins you get does not change even if the number of cards changes later in the turn. The next time you play it, count again. If you play multiple copies, obviously the number will be the same for all of them. It does not matter what order your discard pile is in, but the order your deck is in matters. Do not change that order while counting! You will get to look through your discard pile as you count it. You only get to count your deck and discard pile, not your hand or cards in play or set aside cards. You cannot play more Treasures after buying something in your buy phrase; so for example you cannot buy a card, then play Philosopher's Stone, then buy another card.
41	es	Golem	Acción		Levanta cartas de tu mazo hasta que reveles 2 cartas de Acción que no sean cartas de Golem.<br/>Descarta las demás cartas y luego juega las 2 cartas de Acción en el orden que quieras.	 Reveal cards from the top of your deck, one at a time, until you have revealed two Action cards that are not Golem. If you run out of cards before revealing two non-Golem Actions, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) and continue. If you run out and have no discard pile left either, you just get the Actions you found. Discard all of the revealed cards except for the non-Golem Actions you found. If you did not find any, you're done. If you found one, play it. If you found two, play them both, in either order. You cannot choose not to play one of them. These Action cards are not in your hand and so are unaffected by things that look for cards in your hand. For example, if one of them is Throne Room (from Dominion), you cannot use it on the other one.
42	es	Posesión	Acción		El jugador de tu izquierda jugará un turno extra, después de éste, en el que podrás ver sus cartas y tomarás las decisiones por él. Todas las cartas y fichas que gane el jugador poseído las recibes tú en su lugar y las cartas que tenga que eliminar se dejan aparte, para devolverlas a su pila de descartes al final del turno extra.	 You are not taking a turn with the deck of the player to your left; that player is taking a turn, with you making the decisions and gaining the cards. This is a crucial difference to keep in mind when considering card interactions - the "you" in all cards still refers to the player being Possessed, not the player doing the Possessing. Possession has several pieces to it: -You can see the Possessed player's cards for the entire turn, which means you will see his next hand during Clean-up. You will also see any cards he is entitled to see due to card rules; for example, you can look at cards he has set aside with Native Village (from Seaside). You can count any cards he can count. -Any cards the Possessed player would have gained in any way, you gain instead; this includes cards bought, as well as cards gained due to Actions. The cards you gain this way go to your discard pile, even if they would have gone to that player's hand or the top of his deck or somewhere else. You only gain cards he would have; you do not gain tokens he would have (for example from the Seaside card Pirate Ship). -Possession causes an extra turn to be played, like the card Outpost does (from Seaside). The extra turn happens only after this turn is completely over - you will have discarded everything and drawn your next hand. Outpost only prevents itself from giving a player two consecutive turns, it does not prevent other cards or the rules from doing so. So, for example, if you play Possession in a two player game, then after the Possession turn, that player still gets his normal turn. If he played Outpost during that turn though, it would not give him an extra turn. If you play both Outpost and Possession in the same turn, the Outpost turn happens first. If you make someone play Outpost during a turn in which you Possessed them, that player will get the extra turn and make decisions during it and so forth, not you; if you make someone play Possession during a turn in which you Possessed them, that will make that player Possess the player to his left, rather than you getting to Possess anyone further. Possession turns (and other extra turns) do not count for the tiebreaker. Once the game ends, no further turns are played, including extra turns from Possession and Outpost. -Unlike Outpost, Possession is not a Duration card. It is discarded in the Clean-up phase of the turn you played it.
43	es	Patio	Acción		<b>+3 Cartas</b><br/><br/>Pon una carta de tu mano encima de tu mazo.	 You draw cards and add them to your hand before putting one back. The card you put on top of your deck can be any card in your new hand and doesn't have to be one of the 3 you just drew.
44	es	Peón	Acción		Elige dos opciones distintas:<br/>+1 Carta;<br/>+1 Acción;<br/>+1 Compra;<br/> +<c>1</c>.	 First pick any 2 of the 4 options. You cannot pick the same option twice. After picking both, do both, in either order. You may not choose to draw a card, look at the card drawn, and then make your second choice.
45	es	Cámara Secreta	Acción Reacción		Descarta las cartas que quieras. +<c>1</c> por carta descartada.<hr/>Cuando otro jugador juegue una carta de Ataque, puedes enseñar esta carta de tu mano. Si lo haces, +2 cartas, y luego pones 2 cartas de tu mano encima de tu mazo.	 When you play this as an Action on your turn, you first discard any number of cards from your hand, then get 1 coin per card you discarded. You may choose to discard zero cards, but then you will get zero additional coins. The other ability does nothing at that time as it is only used as a Reaction. When someone else plays an Attack card, you may reveal Secret Chamber from your hand. If you do, first you draw 2 cards, then you put at 2 cards from your hand on top of your deck (in any order). The cards you put back do not have to be the ones you drew. You can put Secret Chamber itself on top of your deck; it's still on your hand when you reveal it. Revealing Secret Chamber happens prior to resolving what an Attack does to you. For example, if another player plays Thief, you can reveal Secret Chamber, draw 2 cards, put 2 back, and then you resolve getting hit by the Thief. You can reveal Secret Chamber whenever another player plays an Attack card, even if that Attack would not affect you. Also, you can reveal more than one Reaction card in response to an Attack. For example, after revealing the Secret Chamber in response to an Attack and resolving the effect of the Secret Chamber, you can still reveal a Moat to avoid the Attack completely.
46	es	Gran Sala	Acción Victoria		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><hr/><big><vp>1</vp></big>	 This is both an Action card and a Victory card. When you play it, you draw a card and may play another Action. At the end of the game, it's worth 1 VP, like an Estate. During set-up, place 12 Great Halls in the Supply for a 3- or 4- [or 5- or 6-] player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.
47	es	Mascarada	Acción		<b>+2 Cartas</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador pasa una carta de su mano al jugador de su izquierda, al mismo tiempo. Después, puedes eliminar una carta de tu mano.	 First you draw 2 cards. Next, each player (all at the same time) chooses a card from his hand and places it face down on the table between him and the player to his left. The player to the left then puts that card into his hand. Cards are passed simultaneously, so you may not look at the card you are receiving until you have chosen a card to pass. Finally, you may trash a card from your hand. Only the player who played Masquerade may trash a card. This is not an Attack and cannot be responded to with Moat or Secret Chamber.
48	es	Chabolas	Acción		<b>+2 Acciones</b><br/><br/>Revela toda tu mano. Si no tienes ninguna carta de Acción en ella, +2 Cartas.	 You get 2 more Actions to use no matter what else happens. Then you must reveal your hand. If you have no Action cards in hand, you draw 2 cards. If the first card you draw is an Action card, you still draw the second card. Action - Victory cards are Action cards.
49	es	Mayordomo	Acción		Elige una opción:<br/>+2 Cartas; o<br/>+<c>2</c>; o bien<br/>eliminar 2 cartas de tu mano.	 If you choose to trash 2 cards and have 2 or more cards in your hand after playing the Steward, then you must trash exactly 2 cards. You may choose to trash 2 cards, even if you only have 1 card left in your hand after playing the Steward; just trash the remaining card in your hand. You cannot mix and match - you either draw 2 cards, get 2 coins, or trash 2 cards.
50	es	Embaucador	Acción Ataque		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) elimina la carta superior de su mazo y gana una carta (que tú eliges) con el mismo coste que la carta eliminada.	 A player with no cards left in his Deck shuffles first; a player who still has no cards does not trash a card or gain a card. If the order matters (such as when piles are running low), resolve Swindler in turn order starting with the player to your left. Gained cards go to discard piles. If a player trashed a 0-cost card such as Copper, you may choose to give him Curse (if there are any left). You can give a player another copy of the same card he trashed. The gained cards have to be ones from the Supply, and you have to pick a card that's left if you can (you cannot pick an empty pile). If there are no cards in the Supply with the same cost as a given player's trashed card, no card is gained by that player. A player who Moats this does not reveal a card from his deck, and so neither trashes a card nor gains a card.
51	es	Pozo de los Deseos	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Nombra una carta. Revela la carta superior de tu mazo. Si se trata de la carta nombrada, ponla en tu mano.	 First you draw your card. Then name a card ("Copper," for example - not "Treasure") and reveal the top card of your deck; if you named the same card you revealed, put the revealed card in your hand. If you do not name the right card, you put the revealed card back on top.
52	es	Barón	Acción		<b>+1 Compra</b><br/><br/>Puedes descartar una carta de Finca.<br/>Si lo haces, +<c>4</c>.<br/>Si no, ganas una carta de Finca.	 You are never obligated to discard an Estate, even if you have one in your hand. However, if you do not discard an Estate, you must gain an Estate (if there are any left); you cannot choose to just get +1 Buy from this Card.
53	es	Puente	Acción		<b>+1 Compra<br/>+<c>1</c></b><br/><br/>Todas las cartas (incluyendo las de las manos de los jugadores) cuestan <c>1</c> menos en este turno, pero nunca menos de <c>0</c>.	 Costs are 1 coin lower for all purposes. For example, if you played Village, then Bridge, then Workshop, you could use Workshop to gain a Duchy (because Duchy now costs 4 Coins due to the Bridge). Then if you played 3 Coins, you could buy a Silver (for 2 Coins) and an Estate (for 1 coin). Cards in players' decks are also affected. The effect is cumulative; if you Throne Room a Bridge, all cards will cost 2 Coins less this turn. Costs never go below 0 Coins. For this reason, if you play Bridge and then play Upgrade, you could trash a Copper (which still costs zero, even though you played Bridge) and gain a Pawn (which costs 1 after Bridge is played).
54	es	Conspirador	Acción		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Si has jugado al menos 3 Acciones este turno (contando esta carta): +1 Carta, +1 Acción.	 You evaluate whether or not Conspirator gives you +1 Card and +1 Action when you play it. Action cards played later in the turn do not change this evaluation. For the purposes of counting actions, if you Throne Room an Action, that's one Action of the Throne Room, one for the selected Action played the first time, and one for the selected Action played the second time. For example, if you play Throne Room on Conspirator, the first conspirator will be your second Action, and won't give you +1 Card or +1 Action, but the second Conspirator will be your third Action, and you will get +1 Card and +1 Action for that second Conspirator. Action - Victory cards are Actions.
55	es	Artesano del Cobre	Acción		Cada carta de Cobre produce <c>1</c> en este turno.	 This just changes how much money you get when playing Copper. The effect is cumulative; if you use Throne Room on Coppersmith, each Copper that you play that turn will produce 3 coins.
56	es	Fundición	Acción		Gana una carta que tenga un coste máximo de <c>4</c>.<br/><br/>Si se trata de una carta…<br/>de Acción, +1 Acción;<br/>de Tesoro, +<c>1</c>;<br/>de Victoria, +1 Carta.	 The card you gain must be from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. You get a bonus depending on what type of card you gained. A card with 2 types gives you both bonuses; if you use Ironworks to gain a Great Hall, you will then draw a card (because Great Hall is a Victory card) and may play another Action (because Great Hall is an Action card). Costs of cards are affected by Bridge. [You cannot gain a card with Potion in the cost with Ironworks.]
57	es	Aldea Minera	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones</b><br/><br/>Puedes eliminar esta carta inmediatamente. Si lo haces, +<c>2</c>.	 You must decide whether or not to trash Mining Village or not before moving on to other actions or other phases. You get a card and +2 Actions, whether you choose to trash it or not. If you trash it you also get +2 Coins. If you Throne Room a Mining Village, you cannot trash Mining Village twice. You will get +1 Card, +2 Actions, and +2 Coins the first time you play it and trash it and when you play it the second time with the Throne Room you get +1 Card and +2 Actions but cannot trash it again.
58	es	Explorador	Acción		<b>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Revela las 4 cartas superiores de tu mazo. Las cartas de Victoria reveladas van a tu mano y las demás cartas reveladas vuelven a la parte superior de tu mazo, en el orden que quieras.	 If there are fewer than 4 cards left in your deck, reveal all the cards in your deck, shuffle your discard pile (which does not include currently revealed cards), and then reveal the remainder needed. Action - Victory cards are Victory cards. Curse cards are not Victory cards. Take all revealed Victory cards into your hand; you cannot choose to leave some on top. You do not have to reveal the order that you put the cards back in.
59	es	Duque	Victoria		Consigues <vp>1</vp> por cada carta Ducado que tengas en tu mazo.	 This does nothing until the end of the game, at which time it's worth 1 VP per Duchy you have. This counts all of your cards - your Discard pile and hand are part of your Deck at that point. During set-up, place 12 Dukes in the Supply for a 3- or 4- [or 5- or 6-] player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.

You get +1 Action whichever option you choose. The options are +2 coins, or everything after that - discarding, drawing 4 cards, and other players discarding and drawing. A player who Moats this neither discards nor draws. Other players are only affected by this if they have 5 or more cards in hand. Other players can use Secret Chamber when you play Minion even if they do not have 5 or more cards in hand. [You make your choice on how to use Minion after other players are done revealing Reactions.]
61	es	Saboteador	Acción Ataque		Cada jugador (menos tú) revela cartas de su mazo hasta que aparezca una con un coste de <c>3</c> o más. Esa carta se elimina y el jugador puede ganar otra carta que cueste hasta <c>2</c> menos. Las demás cartas reveladas se descartan.	 Each other player turns over the top cards of his deck until he reveals one costing 3 coins or more. If a player needs to shuffle to continue revealing cards, he does not shuffle in the already revealed cards. If he goes through all of his cards without finding a card costing 3 coins or more, he just discards everything revealed and is done. If he does find a card costing 3 coins or more, he trashes it, and then may choose to gain a card costing at most 2 coins less than the trashed card. For example, if he trashed a card costing 5 coins, he may gain a card costing up to 3 coins. The gained card must be from the Supply and is put into his discard pile, as are his revealed cards. Costs of cards are affected by Bridge.
62	es	Torturador	Acción Ataque	Requiere: Maldición	<b>+3 Cartas</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) elige una opción: descartar dos cartas; o bien ganar una carta de Maldición, poniéndola en su mano.	 Each other player chooses which option to suffer and then suffers it. A player can choose to gain a Curse even when there are no Curses left, in which case he doesn't gain one; and a player can choose to discard 2 cards even if he has no cards in hand or one card in hand (if he has one card, he discards that single card). Gained Curses go to the players' hands rather than their discard piles. If there aren't enough Curses left for everybody, deal them around in turn order starting with the player to your left. When the order matters (such as with very few Curses left), each player makes his decision of which fate to suffer in turn order.
63	es	Puesto Comercial	Acción		Elimina 2 cartas de tu mano. Si lo haces, ganas una carta de Plata, que pones en tu mano.	 If you have 2 or more cards, you must trash exactly 2 cards and gain a Silver card. The gained Silver card goes into your hand and can be spent the same turn. If the Silver pile is empty, you do not gain a Silver card (but still trash cards if possible). If you only have one card left in your hand and you play Trading Post, you trash the one remaining card but you do not gain a Silver. If you have no cards left when you play this, nothing happens.
64	es	Tributo	Acción		El jugador de tu izquierda revela y descarta las 2 cartas superiores de su mazo. Por cada carta revelada con un nombre diferente, tú ganas: si se trata de una carta...<br/>de Acción, +2 Acciones<br/>de Tesoro, +<c>2</c><br/>de Victoria, +2 Cartas.	 If the player after you has fewer than 2 cards left in his deck, he reveals all the cards in his deck, shuffles his discard pile (which does not include currently revealed cards), and then reveals the remainder needed. The player then discards the revealed cards. If the player after you does not have enough cards to reveal 2, he reveals what he can. You get bonuses for the types of cards revealed, counting only the different cards. A card with 2 types gives you both bonuses. So if the player to your left reveals Copper and Harem, you get +4 Coins and +2 cards; if he reveals 2 Silvers, you just get +2 coins. Curse produces no bonus.
65	es	Mejora	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Elimina una carta de tu mano.<br/>Gana una carta que cueste exactamente <c>1</c> más.	 Draw a card first. Then, you must trash a card from your hand and gain a card costing exactly 1 coin more than the trashed card. The gained card has to be a card in the Supply, and it goes into your discard pile. If there are no cards available for that cost, you do not get one (you still trashed a card though). If you do not have a card in your hand to trash, you neither trash nor gain a card. Card costs are affected by Bridge. Since Bridge affects the costs of the card you trash and then card you gain, in most cases the Bridge will have no net effect. But since cards cannot go below zero in cost, a Bridge played before an Upgrade would allow you to trash a Copper and gain an Estate.
66	es	Harén	Tesoro Victoria		<big><c>2</c><br/><vp>2</vp></big>	 This is both a Treasure card and a Victory card. You can play it for 2 coins, just like a Silver card. At the end of the game, it's worth 2 VP. During set-up, place 12 Harems in the Supply for a 3- or 4- [or 5- or 6-] player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.
67	es	Nobles	Acción Victoria		Elige una opción: +3 Cartas; o bien +2 Acciones.<hr/><big><vp>2</vp></big>	 This is both an Action card and a Victory card. When you play it, you choose either to draw 3 cards or to get 2 more Actions to use; you cannot mix and match. At the end of the game, this is worth 2 VP. During set-up, place 12 Nobles in the Supply for a 3- or 4- [or 5- or 6-] player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.
68	es	Préstamo	Tesoro		<big><c>1</c></big><br/>Al ponerla en juego, revela cartas de tu mazo hasta descubrir un Tesoro. Déscartalo o elimínalo. Descarta las demás cartas reveladas.	 This is a Treasure worth 1 coin, like Copper. When you play it, you reveal cards from the top of your deck until revealing a Treasure card, and then you decide whether to trash that card or discard it. Then you discard all of the other revealed cards. If you run out of cards before revealing a Treasure, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) to get more; if you still do not find a Treasure, just discard all of the revealed cards. Remember that you can play Treasures in any order in the Buy phase and can choose not to play some of your Treasures if you want.
69	es	Ruta comercial	Acción	Requiere: Marcador de Monedas, Tablero de Ruta Comercial	<b>+1 Compra</b><br/>+<c>1</c> por cada Moneda que haya en el tablero de Ruta Comercial. Elimina una carta de tu mano.<hr/>Preparación: coloca una marcador de Moneda en cada mazo de cartas de Victoria del Suministro. Cuando se gane la primera carta de un montón, se mueve la Mondea al Tablero de Ruta Comercial.	 You get an additional Buy to use in your Buy phase. You get +1 coin per token on the Trade Route mat. Then you trash a card from your hand. If you have no cards left in hand, you do not trash one. The amount you get from Trade Route is the same as +1 coin per Victory card pile that a card has been gained from this game. If Victory cards have been gained from outside the Supply piles, for example using the promotional card Black Market, then this does not count those. Put a coin token on each Victory card pile at the start of the game. When a card is gained from a Victory card pile, move its token onto the Trade Route mat. So for example if this game includes the Intrigue card Harem, and so far Harem and Duchy have been bought, but no one has bought (or otherwise gained) Estate or Province or Colony, then Trade Route makes 2 coins. It does not matter who gained the cards or how they gained them. You do not get any extra money if a pile has had multiple cards gained from it or is empty; all that matters is if at least one card has been gained from it. It does not matter if cards have been returned to a pile, such as with Ambassador from Seaside; Trade Route only cares if a card was ever gained from the pile this game. If you are using Black Market and Trade Route is in the Black Market deck, put tokens on Victory card piles at the start of the game.
70	es	Atalaya	Acción Reacción		Roba cartas hasta tener 6 cartas en la mano<hr/>Cada vez que ganes una carta, puedes mostrar esta carta de tu mano para eliminar la carta ganada o ponerla encima de tu mazo.	 When you play this, you draw cards one at a time until you have 6 cards in hand. If you have 6 or more cards in hand already, you do not draw any cards. When you gain a card, even on someone else's turn, you may reveal Watchtower from your hand, to either trash the gained card or put it on top of your deck. You may reveal Watchtower each time you gain a card; for example if another player plays Mountebank, you may use Watchtower to trash both the Curse and Copper, or to trash the Curse and put the Copper on top of your deck, or just to trash the Curse, and so on. You still did gain whatever card you gained; you just immediately trash it. So if Mountebank gives you a Curse and you trash it, the Curse pile will go down by one as the Curse gets moved to the trash pile. You may reveal Watchtower on your own turn as well, for example when buying a card, or gaining a card via something like Expand. If you use Watchtower to put a card on your deck but have no cards left in your deck, you do not shuffle; the gained card becomes the only card in your deck. Revealing Watchtower does not take it out of your hand; you could reveal Watchtower on multiple opponents' turns and still have it on your turn to draw up to 6 with. When cards are gained during a Possession turn (from Alchemy), the player who played Possession is the one who can use Watchtower, not the player who is being possessed. If a gained card is going somewhere other than to your discard pile, such as a card gained with Mine (from Dominion), you can still use Watchtower to trash it or put it on your deck.

VP tokens come in 1 VP and 5 VP denominations and players can make change as needed. Tokens are unlimited and if they run out, use something else to track any further tokens. At the end of the game, players add the total value of their VP tokens to their score.] Trashing a card is optional for the other players but mandatory for you. You trash a card, then each other player may trash a card, in turn order. Only the player who played Bishop can get VP tokens from it. Potion in costs is ignored, for example if you trash Golem (from Alchemy) which costs 4 coins 1 potion, you get 3 VP tokens total (counting the 1 VP you always get from Bishop). If you have no cards left in your hand to trash, you still get the 1 coin and 1 VP token.

73	es	Cantera	Tesoro		<big><c>1</c></big><hr/>Mientras esta carta esté en juego, las cartas de Acción cuestan <c>2</c> menos, pero nunca menos de <c>0</c>.	 This is a Treasure worth 1 coin, like Copper. While it is in play, Action cards cost 2 coins less, to a minimum of 0 coins. It is cumulative; if you play two Quarries during your Buy phase, then King's Court will only cost 3 coins, rather than the usual 7 coins. It affects the costs of cards that are Actions plus another type, such as Nobles (an Action - Victory card in Intrigue). It is also cumulative with other effects that modify costs; if you play Worker's Village in your Action phase, then two Quarries in your Buy phase, Peddler will cost 2 coins. It affects the costs of cards everywhere, such as cards in players' hands.
74	es	Talismán	Tesoro		<big><c>1</c></big><hr/>Mientras esta carta esté en juego, cada vez que compres una carta con un coste de <c>4</c> o menos y que no sea de Victoria, ganas otra copia de dicha carta.	 This is a Treasure worth 1 coin, like Copper. Each time you buy a non-Victory card costing 4 coins or less with this in play, you gain another copy of the bought card. If there are no copies left, you do not gain one. The gained card comes from the Supply and goes into your discard pile. If you have multiple Talismans, you gain an additional copy for each one; if you buy multiple cards for 4 coins or less, Talisman applies to each one. For example if you have two Talismans, four Coppers, and two Buys, you could Buy Silver and Trade Route, gaining two more Silvers and two more Trade Routes. Talisman only affects buying cards; it does not work on cards gained other ways, such as with Expand. A card if a Victory card if Victory is any of its types; for example Great Hall from Intrigue is an Action - Victory card, so it is a Victory card. Talisman only cares about the cost of the card when you buy it, not its normal cost; so for example it can get you a Peddler if you have played two Actions this turn, thus lowering Peddler's cost to 4 coins, or can get you a Grand Market if you played Quarry. [You may not choose to not gain the additional card from Talisman; you must gain an additional one for each Talisman in play if possible.]
75	es	Pueblo de Trabajadores	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones<br/>+1 Compra</b>	 You draw a card, can play two more Actions this turn, and can buy one more card in your Buy phase this turn.

You draw a card and can play two more Actions no matter what. If there is just one empty pile in the Supply, you also draw another card. If there are two or more empty piles, you both draw another card, and get 1 coin to spend and an extra Buy to use in the Buy phase. There are no further bonuses if three or more piles are empty. This only checks how many piles are empty when you play it; if piles become empty later in the turn, you do not go back and get the bonuses. If a pile stops being empty due to cards being returned to it, such as with the Seaside card Ambassador, Cities played after that will not count that pile as empty. An empty trash pile does not count for this.
77	es	Contrabando	Tesoro		<big><c>3</c></big><br/><b>+1 Compra</b><br/>Al ponerla en juego, el jugador de tu izquierda debe nombrar una carta. No podrás comprar la carta nombrada durante este turno.	 This is a Treasure worth 3 coins, like Gold. When you play it, you get +1 Buy, the player to your left names a card, and you cannot buy the named card this turn. This does not stop you from gaining the card in ways other than buying it (such as via Hoard). He does not have to name a card in the Supply. If you play multiple Contrabands in one turn, the player to your left names a card each time; if he names different cards, you cannot buy any of the named cards this turn. You can play Treasures in any order, and you resolve this ability right when you play it, before playing any further Treasure cards. Note that once you buy a card in the Buy phase, you cannot play more Treasures. The number of cards left in a player's hand is public information; you can ask whenever you want to know it (for example, when that player plays Contraband).
78	es	Casa de cuentas	Acción		Busca en tu pila de descartes, revela las cartas de Cobre que quieras y ponlas en tu mano.	 This card lets you look through your discard pile, something you normally are not allowed to do. You only get to look through your discard pile when you play this. You do not have to show the other players your entire discard pile, just the Coppers you take out. After you take out the Coppers, you can leave the cards in your discard pile in any order.
79	es	Acuñador	Acción		Puedes revelar una carta de Tesoro de tu mano. Gana una copia de dicha carta.<hr/>Al comprar esta carta, elimina todos los Tesoros que tengas en juego.	 When you buy this, you trash all of your Treasure cards in play. You do not trash Treasure cards in your hand or elsewhere; just the ones in play, if any. If you buy multiple cards in a turn, trash your Treasures right when you buy Mint; you still have any leftover coins they produced for spending on something else. Remember you do not have to play all of the Treasures from your hand each turn (just all the ones you want producing money for you). You do not get additional chances to play Treasure cards between buys in the Buy phase; first you play Treasures, then you buy cards. When you play Mint, you reveal a Treasure card from your hand and gain a copy of it from the Supply. The gained card goes into your discard pile. The revealed card stays in your hand. The Treasure card can also have other types, like Harem (from Intrigue). If you buy a Mint and use Watchtower to put it on top of your deck or trash it, you still trash all of your Treasures from play. However, if you buy a Mint with Royal Seal in play, the Royal Seal will be gone before you can use it to put Mint on your deck.
80	es	Charlatán	Acción Ataque	Requiere: Maldición	<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) puede descartar una Maldición. Quien no lo haga, gana una carta de Maldición y otra de Cobre.	 This hits the other players in turn order when that matters (such as when the Curse or Copper pile is low). Each of the other players in turn chooses whether or not to discard a Curse card from his hand, and if he does not, gains a Curse and a Copper from the Supply, putting them into his discard pile. If either the Curse or Copper pile is empty, he still gains the other one. If both are empty, he does not gain either, but can still discard Curse if he wants to. A player using Moat (from Dominion) on this may not discard a Curse, and doesn't gain a Curse or Copper - you cannot Moat just part of the attack. A player using Watchtower on this can use it just to trash the Curse, just to trash the Copper, or to trash both.

The other players shuffle if necessary to get 3 cards to reveal, and just reveal what they can if they still have fewer than 3 cards. They discard revealed Treasures and Actions and put the rest back on top in whatever order they want. Cards with more than one type match all of their types; for example if a player reveals Nobles from Intrigue, it is an Action - Victory card, which means it is an Action, so he discards it.
82	es	Sello Real	Tesoro		<big><c>2</c></big><hr/>Mientras esta carta esté en juego, cada vez que ganes una carta, puedes ponerla encima de tu mazo.	 This is a Treasure worth 2 coins, like Silver. If you gain multiple cards with this in play, this applies to each of them - you could put any or all of them on top of your deck. If you use this ability and there are no cards left in your deck, you do not shuffle; the card you gained becomes the only card in your deck. Royal Seal applies to all cards you gain while it is in play, whether bought or gained other ways. If you play the Alchemy card Possession, and during the extra turn you have the possessed played play Royal Seal, he cannot put the card on his deck - he is not gaining the card, you are.

Each other player chooses whether or not to discard 2 cards, then discards 2 cards if he chose to, then draws a card if he did discard 2 cards. If one of the other players has just one card, he can choose to discard it, but will not draw a card. Another player who discards but then has no cards left to draw shuffles in the discards before drawing.
84	es	Especulación	Tesoro		<big><c>1</c></big><br/>Al ponerla en juego, revela cartas de tu mazo hasta descubrir un Tesoro. Descarta las demás cartas reveladas y pon en juego dicha carta de Tesoro.	 This is a Treasure card worth 1 coin, like Copper. When you play it, you reveal cards from your deck until revealing a Treasure card. If you run out of cards before revealing a Treasure, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) to get more; if you still do not find a Treasure, just discard all of the revealed cards. If you do find a Treasure, discard the other cards and play the Treasure. If that Treasure does something when played, do that something. For example if Venture finds you another Venture, you reveal cards again. Remember that you choose what order to play Treasure cards; for example if you have both Venture and Loan in hand, you can play either one first.

At the end of the game, players add the total value of their VP tokens to their score.] You get 1 VP token for each card you buy, but do not get a VP token for gaining a card some other way. Multiple copies of Goons are cumulative; if you have two Goons in play and buy a Silver, you get 2 VP tokens. However if you King's Court a Goons, despite having played the card 3 times, there is still only one copy of it in play, so buying Silver would only get you 1 VP token.
86	es	Gran Mercado	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción<br/>+1 Compra<br/>+<c>2</c></b><hr/>No puedes comprar esta carta si tienes algún Cobre en juego.	 You do not have to play all of the Treasures in your hand in your Buy phase. Coppers in your hand do not stop you from buying Grand Market - only Coppers in play do. Coppers that were in play earlier in the turn but are not anymore also don't stop you; if you have 11 Coppers in play and 2 Buys, you could buy a Mint, trash all of your played Treasures, and then buy a Grand Market. You can gain Grand Market other ways - for example with Expand - whether or not you have Coppers in play. Treasures other than Copper do not prevent you from buying Grand Market, even if they are worth 1 coin (such as Loan).
87	es	Tesoro escondido	Tesoro		<big><c>2</c></big><hr/>Mientras esta carta esté en juego, cada vez que compres una carta de Victoria, ganas una carta de Oro.	 This is a Treasure worth 2 coins, like Silver. When you buy a Victory card with this in play, you gain a Gold card from the Supply, putting it into your discard pile. If there are no Golds left, you do not get one. If you have multiple Hoards in play, you will gain multiple Golds from buying a single one. So for example if you had two Hoards in play and no other money, with +1 Buy, you could buy two Estates and gain four Golds. Victory cards include cards that are other types as well, such as Nobles and Harem in Intrigue. You gain a Gold even if you use Watchtower to immediately trash the Victory card you gained. Victory cards gained other than by buying them do not get you Gold.
88	es	Banco	Tesoro		Al ponerla en juego, te proporciona <c>1</c> por cada carta de Tesoro que tengas en juego (contando esta carta).	 This is a Treasure worth a variable amount. When you play Bank, it is worth 1 coin per Treasure you have in play, counting itself. Remember, you choose what order to play Treasure cards. If you play Bank with no other Treasures in play, it is worth 1 coin. If you play two copies of Bank in a row, the one you play second will be worth 1 coin more than the first one. Bank produces money right when you play it; things that happen later in the turn will not change how much money you got from it.
89	es	Expansión	Acción		Elimina una carta de tu mano. Gana una carta que cueste hasta <c>3</c> más que la carta eliminada.	 This is not in your hand after you play it, so you cannot trash it as the card trashed. The card you gain can cost up to 3 coins more than the trashed card, but it can also cost any smaller amount, even less than the cost of the trashed card. You can trash a card and gain a copy of the same card. If you have no card in hand to trash, you do not gain a card. The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile.
90	es	Forja	Acción		Elimina de tu mano las cartas que quieras. Gana una carta con un coste exactamente igual al coste total en monedas de las cartas eliminadas.	 "Any number" includes zero. If you trash no cards, you have to gain a card costing 0 coins if you can. This is different from how cards like Expand work if you do not trash anything, because Forge looks at the total, not at any one card's cost. If there is no card at the required cost, you do not gain a card. The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. Potion symbols (on cards from Alchemy) are not added, and the card you gain cannot have a potion symbol in its cost.
91	es	Corte Real	Acción		Puedes elegir una carta de Acción de tu mano. Juégala tres veces.	 This is similar to Throne Room (from Dominion), but plays the Action three times rather than twice. You pick another Action card in your hand, play it, play it again, and play it a third time. This does not use up any extra Actions you were allowed to play due to cards like Worker's Village - King's Court itself uses up one Action and that is it. You cannot play any other cards in between resolving the King's Court-ed Action card multiple times, unless that Action card specifically tells you to (such as King's Court itself does). If you King's Court a King's Court, you will play three different Actions after that, playing each one of them three times - you do not play one Action nine times. If you King's Court a card that gives you +1 Action, such as Grand Market, you will end up with 3 Actions left afterwards.
92	es	Buhonero	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción<br/>+<c>1</c></b><hr/>En tu Fase de Compra, esta carta cuesta <c>2</c> menos por cada carta de Acción que tengas en juego, pero nunca menos de <c>0</c>.	 Most of the time, this costs 8 coins. During Buy phases, this costs 2 coins less per Action card you have in play. This cost applies to all Peddler cards, including ones in hands and decks. It never costs less than 0 coins. If you play King's Court on Worker's Village, for example, that is just two Action cards you have in play, even though you played the Worker's Village three times. Buying cards using the promotional card Black Market is something that does not happen during a Buy phase, so Peddler still costs 8 coins then.
93	es	Embargo	Acción	Requiere: Marcadores de Embargo, Maldición	<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/>Elimina esta carta. Coloca un marcador de Embargo sobre un montón del Suministro.<hr/>Cuando un jugador compre una carta, gana una carta de Maldición por cada marcador de Embargo que tenga su montón del Suministro.	 You can pick any pile in the supply. If multiple Embargo cards are used to put Embargo tokens on the same pile, a player gains a Curse card for every Embargo token when they buy a card from that pile. You do not gain a Curse card if you gain a card from an Embargoed pile without buying it (for example, if you gain a card with Smugglers). If you Throne Room an Embargo, you place two Embargo tokens and they do not have to go on the same Supply pile. If you run out of Embargo tokens, use a suitable replacement to mark Embargoed piles. If there are no Curses left, Embargo tokens do nothing.
94	es	Puerto	Acción Duración		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Aparta, boca abajo, una carta de tu mano. Al comienzo de tu próximo turno, ponla de nuevo en tu mano.	 First draw a card; then choose a card from your hand and set it aside, face down. Put the set aside card on the Haven, to remind you what it's for. Other players don't get to see what you put down. You have to set aside a card; it's not optional. Haven and the card stay there until the start of your next turn, at which point you put the set aside card into your hand. Haven itself is discarded during the Clean-up phase of that subsequent turn.
95	es	Faro	Acción Duración		<b>+1 Acción</b><br/>Ahora y al comienzo de tu próximo turno: +<c>1</c><hr/>Mientras esta carta esté en juego, cuando otro jugador juegue una carta de Ataque, éste no te afectarà.	 You get an action and a coin this turn, but only a coin next turn. Attack cards played by other players don't affect you, even if you want them to. You could reveal Secret Chamber in order to draw 2 cards and put 2 cards from your hand back on top of your deck when an Attack card is played, and you will still not suffer from the Attack card. You do still gain the benefits (like +Cards) of Attack cards you play on your turn. Lighthouse is discarded during the Cleanup phase of your next turn.
96	es	Poblado Indígena	Acción	Requiere: Tablero de Poblado Indígena	<b>+2 Acciones</b><br/>Elige una opción: aparta, boca abajo, sobre tu tablero de Poblado Indígena, la carta superior de tu mazo; o bien coloca en tu mano todas las cartas que haya en dicho tablero.<br/>Puedes mirar, en cualquier momento, las cartas que hay en tu tablero de Poblado Indígena. Al final de la partida, devuelve todas esas cartas a tu mazo.	 When you first gain one of these, take a Native Village player mat to put cards from this on. When you play Native Village, either take all of the set aside cards from your Native Village player mat and put them into your hand, or set aside the top card of your deck face down (shuffling first if needed) on the Native Village player mat. You may choose either option even if you have no cards on your mat or no cards in your deck. You may look at the cards on your Native Village player mat at any time. At the end of the game, any cards still on your mat return to your deck for scoring. Native Village itself does not get set aside; it goes to your discard pile during the Clean-up phase.
97	es	Pescador de Perlas	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Mira la última carta de tu mazo. Puedes ponerla encima del mazo.	 Draw a card before you look at the bottom card of your deck. If placing the card on top of your deck, be sure not to look at the next card on the bottom of your deck while moving the card. If you have no cards left when it's time to look at the bottom, you shuffle first.
98	es	Embajador	Acción Ataque		Reveala una carta de tu mano. Devuelve hasta 2 copias de dicha carta, de tu mano al Suministro. Después, cada jugador (menos tú) gana una copia de esa misma carta.	 First you choose and reveal a card from your hand. You may place up to 2 copies of that card from your hand back in the Supply. You may choose not to put any of them back in the Supply. Then the other players each gain a copy of it from the Supply. If the pile for the chosen card runs out, some players may not get one; cards are given out in turn order starting with the next player. If you have no other cards in hand when you play this, it does nothing.
99	es	Pueblo de Pescadores	Acción Duración		<b>+2 Acciones<br/>+<c>1</c></b><br/><br/>Al comienzo de tu próximo turno:<br/>+<c>1</c></b>	 You get a coin to spend and 2 more Actions to use this turn. At the start of your next turn you get a coin and only one more Action. This means you will be able to play 2 Actions total on your next turn (counting your normal Action). Leave this in front of you until the Clean-up phase of your next turn.
100	es	Vigía	Acción		<b>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Mira las 3 cartas superiores de tu mazo: elimina una de ellas, descarta otra y coloca la tercera encima de tu mazo.	 If you do not have 3 cards to look at from the top of your deck, look at as many as you can and then shuffle your discard pile to look at the remaining cards. You should look at all 3 cards before deciding which to trash, which card to discard, and which card to put back on top of your deck. If the 3 cards you look at are the last 3 cards in your deck, the card you put back on top of your deck will be the only card left in your deck. If you have less than 3 cards to look at, even after shuffling, then you must follow the instructions on the card in order. If you only have one card to look at, you must trash it. If you have 2 cards to look at, you must trash one and discard one.
101	es	Contrabandistas	Acción		Gana una copia de una de las cartas que el jugador de tu derecha haya ganado en su último turno, con un coste máximo de <c>6</c>.	 This looks at the most recent turn of the player to your right, even if you've taken multiple turns in a row. If that player gained no cards, or nothing costing 6 or less, then Smugglers does nothing. If that player gained multiple cards costing 6 or less, you choose which one to gain a copy of. Gained cards must come from the supply. They can be any card gained, whether bought or otherwise gained; you can even gain a card that the previous player gained with Smugglers. If the previous player gained a card via Black Market, you will not be able to gain a copy of it (no copies of it in the supply.) This is not an Attack; Lighthouse and Moat can't stop it. You cannot gain cards with Potion in the cost with Smugglers.
102	es	Almacén	Acción		<b>+3 Cartas<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Descarta 3 cartas.	 If you do not have 3 cards to draw in your deck, draw as many as you can, shuffle your discard pile, and draw the remaining cards. If you are still not able to draw 3 cards, draw as many as you can. You will still need to discard 3 cards if you can, even if you couldn't draw 3. You may discard any combination of cards that you just drew with the Warehouse or cards that were previously in your hand.
103	es	Caravana	Acción Duración		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/>Al comienzo de tu próximo turno: +1 Carta.	 Draw a card at the start of your next turn (not before); Caravan itself is discarded during the Cleanup phase of that subsequent turn.
104	es	Ratero	Acción Ataque		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) descarta una carta de Cobre (o revela su mano si no tiene ninguna carta de Cobre).	 Other players must discard one and only one Copper. If they do not have a Copper, they must reveal their hand for all players to see.
105	es	Isla	Acción Victoria	Requiere: Tablero de Isla	Aparta esta carta y otra cualquiera de tu mano. Devuélvelas a tu mazo al final de la partida.<hr/><big><vp>2</vp></big>	 When you first take this card, take an Island player mat. Island is both an Action card and a Victory card. Use 8 Islands in a 2 player game, 12 Islands in a 3+ player game. Island and the card set aside with it are set aside face up on the Island player mat provided. They should not be shuffled back into your deck when you shuffle your discard pile. They are returned to your deck at the end of the game in order to calculate total victory points. Island is worth 2 VP. If you have no other cards in hand when you play Island, just set Island aside by itself. If you Throne Room an Island, set aside the Island and a card from your hand, then set aside another card from your hand. You may look through the cards on your Island playing mat and other players may ask to see them as well.
106	es	Navegante	Acción		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Mira las 5 cartas superiores de tu mazo. Elige una opción: descartar las 5 cartas; o bien devolverlas a tu mazo, en el orden que quieras.	 You discard all 5 cards or none of them. If you don't discard them, put them back in any order. If there aren't 5 cards left in your deck, look at as many as you can, then shuffle your discard pile (not including the cards you are currently looking at), and look at the rest. If there still aren't 5, you just look at however many are left, and put them back or discard them.
107	es	Barco Pirata	Acción Ataque	Requiere: Marcador de Monedas, Tablero de Barco Pirata	Elige una opción: cada jugador (menos tú) revela las 2 cartas superiores de su mazo, elimina el Tesoro revelado que tú decidas, descarta las demás cartas reveladas y tú ganas un marcador de Moneda (si alguien ha eliminado un tesoro); o bién +<c>1</c> por cada marcador de Moneda que hayas conseguido en esta partida utilizando Barcos Piratas.	 When you first take this card, take a Pirate Ship player mat. If you use the Pirate Ship to trash treasures, a player with just one card left reveals that last card and then shuffles to get the other card to reveal (without including the revealed card); a player with no cards left shuffles to get both of them. A player who still doesn't have two cards to reveal after shuffling just reveals what he can. Each player trashes one Treasure card at most, of the attacker's choice from the two revealed cards. As long as you trashed at least one Treasure card in this way, place a Coin token on your Pirate Ship player mat. You can't get more than one Coin token each time you play Pirate Ship, no matter how many treasures it trashes. If you choose not to try to trash treasures from the other players, the Pirate Ship is worth one coin for each Coin token on your Pirate Ship player mat. The Coin tokens are cumulative, so after you have used your Pirate Ships to trash coins 3 times (and you trash at least one Treasure card each time), any Pirate Ship you play could be worth 3 coins. Pirate Ship is an Action- Attack and players can reveal Secret Chamber even if you choose to use Pirate Ship for the coin value. [You make your choice on how to use Pirate Ship after other players are done revealing Reactions.]
108	es	Rescatador	Acción		<b>+1 Compra</b><br/>Elimina una carta de tu mano.<br/>+<c/> igual al coste de la carta eliminada.	 If you have at least one card in your hand, then you must trash one. If you don't have a card in hand left to trash, you get no coins, but still get the +1 Buy.
109	es	Bruja del Mar	Acción Ataque	Requiere: Maldición	Cada jugador (menos tú) descarta la carta superior de su mazo, gana un carta de Maldición y la coloca encima de su mazo.	 A player with no cards left in his deck shuffles first in order to get a card to discard. If he still has no cards, he doesn't discard one. A player discarding his last card to this has the gained Curse become the only card in his deck. If there aren't enough Curses left to go around, deal them out in turn order, starting with the player to the left of the player who played Sea Hag.
110	es	Mapa del Tesoro	Acción		Elimina esta carta y otro Mapa del Tesoro de tu mano. Si lo haces ganas 4 cartas de Oro, que se colocan encima de tu mazo.	 You can play this without another Treasure Map in your hand; if you do, you trash this and gain nothing. You have to actually trash two copies of Treasure Map to gain the Golds; so for example if you Throne Room a Treasure Map, with two more Treasure Maps in hand, then the first time Treasure Map resolves you trash it and another one and gain 4 Golds, and the second time it resolves you trash your other Treasure Map but gain nothing (since you didn't actually trash the played Treasure Map that time). If there aren't enough Gold cards left, just gain what you can. The gained Golds go on top of your Deck. If your deck was empty they become the only cards in it.
111	es	Bazar	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones<br/>+<c>1</c></b>	 You draw a card, get 2 more Actions to use, and get 1 more coin to spend this turn.
112	es	Exploradora	Acción		Puedes revelar una carta de Provincia de tu mano. Si lo haces, ganas una carta de Oro. Si no lo haces, ganas una carta de Plata. La carta ganada va directamente a tu mano.	 You don't have to reveal a Province if you have one. If you do reveal one you gain a Gold, otherwise you gain a Silver. The gained card comes from the supply and is put into your hard; it can be spent the same turn.
113	es	Barco Fantasma	Acción Ataque		<b>+2 Cartas</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) con 4 cartas o más en su mano, pone cartas de su mano encima de su mazo, hasta quedarse con 3 cartas en la mano.	 The other players choose which cards they put on their decks and in what order. This has no effect on another player who already has only 3 cards in hand. A player with no cards left in their deck does not shuffle; the cards put back become the only cards in their deck.
114	es	Barco Mercante	Acción Duración		Ahora y al comienzo de tu próximo turno: +<c>2</c>	 You get 2 coins to spend this turn, and 2 more on your next turn. Leave this in front of you until the Clean-up phase of your next turn.
115	es	Puesto Avanzado	Acción Duración		En la Fase de Mantenimiento de este turno, roba sólo 3 cartas (en vez de 5). A continuación, haz un Turno Extra (pero nunca puedes hacer más de dos turnos consecutivos).	 The extra turn is completely normal except that your starting hand for it is only 3 cards. This means that you only drew 3 cards instead of 5 cards during the Clean-up phase of the turn when you played Outpost. Leave Outpost in front of you until the end of the extra turn. If you play Outpost as well as a "Now and at the start of your next turn" card, such as Merchant Ship, the turn from Outpost will be that next turn, so you'll get those coins then. If you manage to play Outpost twice in one turn, you will still only get one extra turn. If you play Outpost during an extra turn, it won't give you another turn.
116	es	Estratega	Acción Duración		Descarta tu mano.<br/>Si descartas alguna carta; al comienzo de tu próximo turno: +5 Cartas, +1 Compra, y +1 Acción.	 You wait until the start of your next turn to draw the 5 extra cards; you don't draw them at the end of the turn you played Tactician. Tactician stays out in front of you until the Clean-up phase of your next turn. Because you must discard at least one card in order to gain the bonuses from tactician, it is not possible to Throne Room a Tactician to get +10 cards, +2 Buys, and +2 Actions. You will have to discard all of your cards with the first Tactician and you will not have cards left in your hand to trigger the card drawing or the extra Buy or the extra Action when you play Tactician for the second time.
117	es	Tesorería	Acción		<b>+1 Cartas<br/>+1 Acción<br/>+<c>1</c></b><hr/>Al descartar esta carta de tu área de juego, si no has comprado ninguna carta de Victoria en este turno, puedes poner esta carta encima de tu mazo.	 If you buy multiple cards and at least one of them is a Victory card, then none of your Treasuries can be put on top of your deck. If you played multiple Treasuries and did not buy a Victory card this turn, then you can put any or all of the played Treasuries on top of your deck. If you forget and discard a Treasury to your discard pile, then essentially you have chosen not to use the optional ability. You may not dig through your discard pile to retrieve it later. Gaining a Victory card without buying it, such as with Smugglers, does not stop you from putting Treasury on top of your deck.
118	es	Muelle	Acción Duración		Ahora y al comienzo de tu próximo turno:<br/><br/><b>+2 Cartas<br/>+1 Compra</b>	 You draw 2 cards and get an extra Buy this turn, and then draw 2 more cards and get another extra Buy at the start of your next turn. You don't draw your extra 2 cards for the next turn until that turn actually starts. Leave this in front of you until the Clean-up phase of your next turn.
119	es	Hospicio	Acción		<b>+<c>4</c></b><br/><br/>Revela tu mano. -<c>1</c> por carta de Tesoro que tengas en tu mano, hasta un mínimo de <c>0</c>.	 First you get +4 Coins. Then you reveal your hand, and lose 1 Coin per Treasure card in it. You can lose more than 4 Coins this way, but the amount of coins you have available to spend can never go below 0 Coins. Cards with two types, one of which is Treasure (such as Harem from Intrigue) are Treasure cards.
120	es	Mendigo	Acción Reacción		Gana 3 cartas de Cobre y ponlas en tu mano.<hr/>Cuando otro jugador juegue una carta de Ataque, puedes descartar esta carta. Si lo haces, gana dos cartas de Plata y pon una de ellas encima de tu mazo.	 When you play this, you gain three Coppers from the Supply, putting them into your hand. If there are not three Coppers left, just gain as many as you can. When another player plays an Attack card, you may discard this from your hand. If you do, you gain two Silvers from the Supply, putting one on your deck and the other into your discard pile. If there is only one Silver left, put it on your deck; if there are no Silvers left, you do not gain any.
121	es	Escudero	Acción		<b>+<c>1</c></b><br/><br/>Elige una opción: +2 Acciones; o bien +2 Compras; o bien gana una carta de Plata.<hr/>Cuando elimines esta carta, gana una carta de Ataque.	 When you play this, you get +1 Coins, and your choice of either +2 Actions, +2 Buys, or gaining a Silver. The Silver comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. If Squire is trashed somehow, you gain an Attack card; the Attack card comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. You can gain any Attack card available in the Supply, but if no Attack card is available, you do not gain one.
122	es	Vagabundo	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Revela la carta superior de tu mazo. Si es una carta de Maldición, Ruinas, Cobijo o Victoria, ponlas en tu mano.	 You draw a card before revealing your top card. If the top card of your deck is a Curse, Ruins, Shelter, or Victory card, it goes into your hand; otherwise it goes back on top. A card with multiple types goes into your hand if at least one of the types is Curse, Ruins, Shelter, or Victory.

Trash a card from your hand if you can. Whether or not you can, you still get +1 Coin er differently named Treasure in the trash, plus +1 Action and +1 Buy. Multiple copies of the same Treasure card do not increase how much you get. For example, if the trash has four Coppers, a Counterfeit, and six Estates, you get +2 Coins. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Treasure (such as Harem from Intrigue), are Treasures.
124	es	Ermitaño	Acción	Requiere: Loco	Mira tu pila de descartes. Puedes eliminar una carta de tu pila de descartes o de tu mano no sea una carta de tesoro.<br/>Gana una carta con un coste máximo de <c>3</c>.<hr/>Cuando descartes esta carta de tu zona de juego, si no compraste ninguna carta en estes turno, elimina esta carta y gana un Loco del montón de Locos.	 When you play this, look through your discard pile, and then you may choose to trash a card that is not a Treasure, from either your hand or your discard pile. You do not have to trash a card and cannot trash Treasures. A card with multiple types, one of which is Treasure (such as Harem from Intrigue), is a Treasure. After trashing or not, you gain a card costing up to 3 Coins. The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. Gaining a card is mandatory if it is possible. Then, when you discard Hermit from play - normally, in Clean-up, after playing it in your Action phase - if you did not buy any cards this turn, you trash Hermit and gain a Madman. The Madman comes from the Madman pile, which is not in the Supply, and is put into your discard pile. It does not matter whether or not you gained cards other ways, only whether or not you bought a card. If there are no Madman cards left, you do not gain one. If Hermit is not discarded from play during Clean-up - for example, if you put it on your deck with Scheme (from Hinterlands) - then the ability that trashes it will not trigger.
125	es	Plaza del Mercado	Acción Reacción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción<br/>+1 Compra</b><hr/>Cuando elimines una de tus cartas, puedes descartarte de esta carta de tu mano. Si lo haces, gana una carta de Oro.	 When you play this, you draw a card and get +1 Action and +1 Buy. When one of your cards is trashed, you may discard Market Square from your hand. If you do, you gain a Gold. The Gold comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. If there is no Gold left in the Supply, you do not gain one. You may discard multiple Market Squares when a single card of yours is trashed.
126	es	Sabio	Acción		<b>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Revela las cartas superiores de tu mazo hasta revelar una carta que cueste <c>3</c> o más. Pon esta carta en tu mano y descarta el resto.	 If you run out of cards while revealing cards, shuffle your discard pile (not including the revealed cards) and continue. If you run out of cards to reveal and have no cards in your discard pile, stop there; discard everything revealed, and you do not get a card. If you find a card costing 3 Coins or more, put that one into your hand and discard the rest. For example you might reveal Copper, then Copper, then Curse, then Province; Province costs 8 Coins, so you would stop there, put Province in your hand, and discard the two Coppers and the Curse.

Discard any number of cards from your hand, and draw as many cards as you discarded. Then, discard any number of cards - which could include cards you just drew - and you get +1 Coins per card you discarded that time.

Si lo haces, gana un Mercenario del montón de Mercenarios.	 When you play this, you draw a card and get +1 Action, then each other player discards down to 4 cards in hand. Players who already have 4 or fewer cards in hand do not do anything. While Urchin is in play, when you play another Attack card, before resolving it, you may trash the Urchin. If you do, you gain a Mercenary. The Mercenary comes from the Mercenary pile, which is not in the Supply, and is put into your discard pile. If there are no Mercenaries left you do not gain one. If you play the same Urchin twice in one turn, such as via Procession, that does not let you trash it for a Mercenary. If you play two different Urchins however, playing the second one will let you trash the first one.

When you play Death Cart, you get + 5 Coins, and either trash an Action card from your hand, or trash the Death Cart. If you have no Action card in your hand, you will have to trash the Death Cart, but you can trash the Death Cart whether or not you have an Action card in hand. A card with multiple types, one of which is Action, is an Action card. When you gain a Death Cart, either from buying it or from gaining it some other way, you also gain 2 Ruins. You just take the top 2, whatever they are. If there are not enough Ruins left, take as many as you can. The Ruins come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. The other players get to see which ones you got. The player gaining Death Cart is the one who gains Ruins; if Possession (from Alchemy) is used to make another player buy Death Cart, the player actually gaining the Death Cart (the one who played Possession) gains the Ruins. If you use Trader (from Hinterlands) to take a Silver instead of a Death Cart, you do not gain any Ruins. It doesn't matter whose turn it is; if you use Ambassador (from Seaside) to give Death Carts to each other player, those players also gain Ruins. Passing cards with Masquerade (from Intrigue) does not count as gaining them.
131	es	Feudo	Victoria		Esta carta vale <vp>1</vp> por cada 3 cartas de Plata que tengas en tu mazo (redondeando hacia abajo).<hr/>Cuando elimines esta carta, gana 3 cartas de Plata.	 This is a Victory card. Play with 8 for games with 2 players, or 12 cards for games with 3 or more players. At the end of the game, each Feodum is worth 1 Victory for every 3 Silvers in your deck, rounded down. For example, if you have 11 Silvers, your Feodums are worth 3 Victory each. If a Feodum is trashed, you gain 3 Silvers. The Silvers come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. If there are not enough Silvers left, gain as many as you can.
132	es	Fortaleza	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones</b><hr/>Cuando elimines esta carta, ponla en tu mano.	 When you play this, you draw a card and get +2 Actions. If this is trashed, you take it from the trash and put it into your hand. This happens no matter whose turn it is when Fortress is trashed. It is not optional. You still trashed Fortress, even though you get it back; for example if you play Death Cart and choose to trash Fortress, the "if you do" on Death Cart is true, you did trash an Action, so you do not trash Death Cart.
133	es	Ferretero	Acción Ataque		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/>Revela la carta superior de tu mazo y descártala si quieres. Tanto si la descartas como si no, si se trata de...<br/>una carta de Acción, +1 Acción<br/>una carta de Tesoro, +<c>1</c><br/>Una carta de Victoria, +1 Carta.	 First you draw a card, then you reveal the top card of your deck, then you either discard that card or put it back on top of your deck. Then you get bonuses based on the types of the card you revealed. A card with 2 types gives you both bonuses; for example, if you revealed Harem (from Intrigue), you would both draw a card and get +1 Coins.
134	es	Salteador	Acción Ataque Saqueador	Requiere: Botín, Ruinas	Gana una carta de Botín del montón de Botines.<br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) gana una carta de ruinas.	 First you gain a Spoils. It comes from the Spoils pile, which is not part of the Supply, and is put into your discard pile. If there are no Spoils cards left, you do not get one. Then each other player gains a Ruins. These come from the Ruins pile in the Supply, and are put into discard piles. Go in turn order starting to your left; each player takes the top Ruins, revealing the next one each time. If the Ruins pile runs out, players stop gaining them at that point.
135	es	Procesión	Acción		Puedes jugar una carta de Acción de tu mano dos veces. Elimínala. Gana una carta de Acción que cueste exactamente <c>1</c> más que la carta eliminada.	 Playing an Action card from your hand is optional. If you do play one, you then play it a second time, then trash it, then gain an Action card costing exactly 1 Coin more than it (even if somehow you failed to trash it). Gaining a card is not optional once you choose to play an Action card, but will fail to happen if no card in the Supply costs the exact amount needed. If something happens due to trashing the card - for example drawing 3 cards due to trashing a Cultist - that will resolve before you gain a card. The gained card comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. This does not use up any extra Actions you were allowed to play due to cards like Fortress - Procession itself uses up one Action and that is it. You cannot play any other cards in between resolving the Procession-ed Action card multiple times, unless that Action card specifically tells you to (such as Procession itself does). If you Procession a Procession, you will play one Action twice, trash it, gain an Action card costing 1 Coin more, then play another Action twice, trash it, gain an Action card costing 1 Coin more, then trash the Procession and gain an Action costing 1 Coin more than it. If you Procession a card that gives you +1 Action, such as Vagrant, you will end up with 2 Actions to use afterwards, rather than the one you would have left if you just played two Vagrants. If you use Procession on a Duration card (from Seaside), Procession will stay out until your next turn and the Duration card will have its effect twice on your next turn, even though the Duration card is trashed.
136	es	Ratas	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/>Gana una carta de Ratas. Elimina una carta de tu mano que se a una carta de Ratas (o bien revela tu mano mostrando que sólo tienes cartas de Ratas).<hr/>Cuando elimines esta carta, +1 carta.	 Follow the instructions in order. First draw a card; then gain a Rats from the Supply, putting it into your discard pile; then trash a card from your hand that is not a Rats card. If there are no Rats cards left, you do not gain one. If you have no cards in your hand other than Rats, reveal your hand and you do not trash a card. If Rats is trashed, you draw a card. This happens whether it is your turn or another player's, and regardless of which player has the card that trashed Rats. There are 20 copies of Rats, rather than the usual 10; the pile starts with all 20, regardless of the number of players.
137	es	Carroñero	Acción		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/><br/>Puedes poner tu mazo en tu pila de descartes. Mira en tu pila de de descartes y pon una carta de la pila encima de tu mazo.	 Putting your deck into your discard pile is optional, but putting a card from your discard pile on top of your deck is not; you do it unless there are no cards in your discard pile. Putting your deck into your discard pile will not trigger Tunnel (from Hinterlands). If your deck has no cards in it, such as from putting them into your discard pile, then the card you put on top of your deck will be the only card in your deck.
138	es	Juglar	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones</b><br/><br/>Revela las 3 cartas superiores de tu mazo. Devuelve las cartas de Acción encima del mazo en el orden que desees y descarta el resto.	 First draw a card, then reveal the top 3 cards of your deck, shuffling your discard pile if there are not enough cards in your deck. If there still are not enough after shuffling, just reveal what you can. Put the revealed Action cards on top of your deck in any order, and discard the other cards. A card with multiple types, one of which is Action, is an Action card. If you didn't reveal any Action cards, no cards will be put on top.
139	es	Banda de Rufianes	Acción		Juega esta carta como si fuera la carta de Acción que elijas del Suministro y que cueste menos que ella.<br/>Esta carta se considera la carta elegida hasta el momento de abandonar la zona de juego.	 When you play this, you pick an Action card from the Supply that costs less than it, and treat this card as if it were the card you chose. Normally this will just mean that you follow the instructions on the card you picked. So, if you play Band of Misfits and Fortress is in the Supply, you could pick that and then you would draw a card and get +2 Actions, since that is what Fortress does when you play it. Band of Misfits also gets the chosen card's cost, name, and types. If you use Band of Misfits as a card that trashes itself, such as Death Cart, you will trash the Band of Misfits (at which point it will just be a Band of Misfits card in the trash). If you use Band of Misfits as a duration card (from Seaside), Band of Misfits will stay in play until next turn, just like the duration card would. If you use Band of Misfits as a Throne Room (from Dominion), King's Court (from Prosperity), or Procession, and use that effect to play a duration card, Band of Misfits will similarly stay in play. If you use Throne Room, King's Court, or Procession to play a Band of Misfits card multiple times, you only pick what to play it as the first time; the other times it is still copying the same card. For example, if you use Procession to play Band of Misfits twice and choose Fortress the first time, you will automatically replay it as Fortress, then trash the Band of Misfits, return it to your hand (it is a Fortress when it's trashed, and Fortress has a when-trashed ability that returns it to your hand), and gain an Action card costing exactly 6 Coins(1 Coin more than Band of Misfits, which has left play and so is no longer copying Fortress). If you use Band of Misfits as a card that does something during Clean-up, such as Hermit, it will do that thing during Clean-up. When you play Horn of Plenty (from Cornucopia), it counts Band of Misfits as whatever Band of Misfits was played as; for example if you play a Band of Misfits as a Fortress, and then play another Band of Misfits as a Scavenger, and then play Horn of Plenty, you will gain a card costing up to 3 Coins. Band of Misfits can only be played as a card that is visible in the Supply; it cannot be played as a card after its pile runs out, and cannot be played as a non-Supply card like Mercenary; it can be played as the top card of the Ruins pile, but no other Ruins, and can only be played as Sir Martin when that is the top card of the Knights pile
140	es	Campamento de Bandidos	Acción	Requiere: Botín	<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones</b><br/><br/>Gana una carta de Botín del montón de Botines.	 Draw a card before gaining a Spoils. The Spoils comes from the Spoils pile, which is not part of the Supply, and is put into your discard pile. If there are no Spoils cards left, you do not get one.

When you play this, you look at the top 3 cards of your deck, and either put all 3 into your hand, or discard all 3 and draw the next 3 cards. If you discard them and have to shuffle to draw 3 cards, you will shuffle in the cards you discarded and may end up drawing some of them. When you trash Catacombs, you gain a card costing less than it. This happens whether Catacombs is trashed on your turn or someone else's, and no matter who has the card that trashed it. The gained card comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile.
142	es	Conde	Acción		Elige una opción: descarta 2 cartas; o bien pon una carta de mano encima de tu mazo; o bien gana una carta de Cobre.<br/><br/>Elige una opción: +<c>3</c>; o bien elimina tu mano; o bien gana una carta de Ducado.	 This card gives you two separate choices: first you either discard 2 cards, put a card from your hand on top of your deck, or gain a Copper; after resolving that, you either get +3 Coins, trash your hand, or gain a Duchy. For example, you might choose to discard 2 cards, then gain a Duchy. Gained cards come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. You can choose an option even if you cannot do it. If you trash multiple cards that do something when trashed at once, trash them all, then choose an order to resolve the things that happen due to them being trashed.
143	es	Falsificación	Tesoro		<big><c>1</c></big><br/><b>+1 Compra</b><br/>Cuando juegues esta carta, puedes jugar una carta de Tesoro de tu mano dos veces. Si lo haces, elimina esa carta de tesoro.	 This is a Treasure worth 1 Coin. You play it in your Buy phase, like other Treasures. When you play it, you also get +1 Buy, and you may play an additional Treasure card from your hand twice. If you choose to do that, you trash that Treasure. You still get any coins that Treasure gave you from playing it, despite trashing it. If you use Counterfeit to play Spoils twice, you will get + 6 Coins, (in addition to the 1 Coin, from Counterfeit) and return Spoils to the Spoils pile; you will be unable to trash it. If you use Counterfeit to play a Treasure that does something special when you play it, you will do that thing twice. Cards with two types, one of which is Treasure (such as Harem from Intrigue) are Treasures and so can be played via Counterfeit.
144	es	Sectario	Acción Ataque Saqueador	Requiere: Ruinas	<b>+2 Cartas</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) gana una carta de Ruinas. Puedes jugar un Sectario de tu mano.<hr/>Cuando elimines esta carta, +3 Cartas.	 When you play this, you draw two cards, then each other player gains a Ruins. These come from the Ruins pile in the Supply, and are put into discard piles. Go in turn order starting to your left; each player takes the top Ruins, revealing the next one each time. If the Ruins pile runs out, players stop gaining them at that point. After giving out Ruins, you may play another Cultist from your hand. It can be one you just drew from playing Cultist, or one you already had in your hand. Playing a Cultist this way does not use up any extra Actions you were allowed to play due to cards like Fortress - the original Cultist uses up one Action and that is it. When you trash a Cultist of yours, you draw three cards. This happens whether or not it is your turn, and whether or not the card that causes Cultist to be trashed was yours. If you trash a Cultist while revealing cards, such as to a Knight attack, you do not draw the revealed cards that are about to be discarded.

You choose either option, then do as much of it as you can; you can choose an option even if you will not be able to do it. You can look through the trash at any time. If you choose to gain a card from the trash, the other players get to see what it is, and it goes on top of your deck. If there were no cards in your deck, it becomes the only card in your deck. If there is no card in the trash costing from 3 Coins to 6 Coins, you will fail to gain one. Cards with Potion in the cost (from Alchemy) do not cost from 3 Coins to 6 Coins. If you choose to trash an Action card from your hand, the card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile.

147	es	Caballero	Acción Ataque Caballero		Mezcla el montón de Caballeros antes de cada partida en la que vayas a jugar con ellos. Deja el montón boca abajo excepto la carta superior, que es la única que puede comprarse o ganarse.	 The ability Knights have in common is that each other player reveals the top 2 cards of his deck, trashes one of them that he chooses that costs from 3 Coins to 6 Coins, and discards the rest; then, if a Knight was trashed, you trash the Knight you played that caused this trashing. Resolve this ability in turn order, starting with the player to your left. Cards with Potion in the cost (from Alchemy) do not cost from 3 Coins to 6 Coins. The player losing a card only gets a choice if both cards revealed cost from 3 Coins to 6 Coins; if they both do and one is a Knight but the player picks the other card, that will not cause the played Knight to be trashed. When Sir Martin is the top card of the pile, it can be gained with an Armory and so on. If Sir Vander is trashed, you gain a Gold; this happens whether it is trashed on your turn or someone else's. The player who had Sir Vander is the one who gains the Gold, regardless of who played the card that trashed it. The Gold from Sir Vander, and the card gained for Dame Natalie, comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. When playing Dame Anna, you may choose to trash zero, one, or two cards from your hand. Dame Josephine is also a Victory card, worth 2 Victory at the end of the game. The Knight pile is not a Victory pile though, and does not get a counter for Trade Route (from Prosperity) even if Dame Josephine starts on top. If you choose to use the Knights with Black Market (a promotional card), put a Knight directly into the Black Market deck, rather than using the randomizer card. Sir Martin only costs 4 Coins, though the other Knights all cost 5 Coins.

You get +1 Action and +2 Coins. Then name a card ("Copper," for example - not "Treasure") and reveal the top card of your deck; if you named the same card you revealed, put the revealed card into your hand. If you do not name the right card, put the revealed card back on top. You do not need to name a card being used this game. Names need to match exactly for you to get the card; for example Sir Destry and Sir Martin do not match. You do not need to name a card available in the Supply.

This happens in turn order, starting with the player to your left. Then you gain two Spoils cards. The two Spoils cards come from the Spoils pile, which is not part of the Supply, and are put into your discard pile. If there are no Spoils cards left, you do not get one; if there is only one, you just get one.

You can name any card, whether or not it is being used this game or is a Victory card. Then reveal cards from your deck until you reveal a Victory card that is not what you named. If you run out of cards, shuffle your discard pile and continue, without shuffling in the revealed cards. If you run out of cards with no cards left in your discard pile, stop there, discard everything, and nothing more happens. If you did find a Victory card that was not what you named, you discard the other revealed cards, trash the Victory card, and gain a Victory card costing up to 3 Coins more than the trashed card. The card you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile.

If there is a card in the trash costing from 3 Coins to 6 Coins, you have to gain one of them; it is not optional. You can look through the trash at any time. The other players get to see what card you took. The gained card goes into your discard pile. Cards with Potion in the cost (from Alchemy) do not cost from 3 Coins to 6 Coins. If there was no card in the trash costing from 3 Coins to 6 Coins, you instead have each other player reveal the top 2 cards of his deck, trash one of them of his choice that costs from 3 Coins to 6 Coins (if possible), and discard the rest. Go in turn order, starting with the player to your left.

If he runs out of cards before finding one, he shuffles his discard pile (but not the revealed cards), and keeps revealing cards. If he still cannot find one, he just discards all of the revealed cards. If he does find one, he puts the Victory or Curse card on top of his deck, and discards the other revealed cards. If his deck has no other cards in it, it becomes the only card in his deck. A card with multiple types, one of which is Victory (such as Nobles from Dominion: Intrigue), is a Victory card. You do not choose Victory or Curse - they stop on the first card that matches either type.

If there are any two or more cards in your hand with the same name, you only draw one card; if there are no matches, you draw three cards. Only the card names matter for this; Copper and Silver are different cards for example, despite both being Treasures. If you have no cards in hand at all after playing Menagerie, then you have no matching cards, and so get +3 Cards.

If you run out of cards before finding one, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards), and keep revealing cards. If you still cannot find one, just discard all of the revealed cards. If you do find a Treasure or Action card, put it into your hand, and discard the rest of the revealed cards. A card with multiple types, one of which is Treasure or Action (for example Diadem, a Treasure - Prize), is a Treasure or Action and so will be drawn by this. You do not choose Treasure or Action – you stop on the first card matching either type.

If you do not have enough cards to discard, just discard what you can; you still get the +1 Buy and +3 coins. When another player plays an Attack card, before that card does anything, you may reveal this from your hand. If you do, you set it aside, and at the start of your next turn, you return it to your hand and draw a card. While it is set aside, it is not in play or in your hand, and cannot be further revealed to Attacks. Therefore it will only work on one Attack per round of turns. You can reveal it for an Attack and still play it on your next turn. You can reveal multiple Horse Traders to a single Attack. For example, if another player plays Followers, you could reveal and set aside two Horse Traders from your hand, then gain a Curse but discard no cards, as you would only have three cards in hand at that point. Then on your next turn you would pick up the two Horse Traders and also draw two cards.

If you have no cards in hand, you do not trash anything or gain anything; if you have only one card in hand, trash it and gain a card costing 1 coin more than it. Gained cards come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. If there is no card at the exact cost needed, you do not gain a card for that trashed card. For example you could use Remake to trash an Estate, gaining a Silver, then trash a Copper, gaining nothing.

Then each player, including you, may reveal a Province card from his hand. Then, if you revealed a Province, discard that card, and you gain a Prize of your choice, or a Duchy, putting whatever card you took on top of your deck. If there were no cards in your deck, it becomes the only card in your deck. There are five Prizes, set out at the start of the game; see Preparation. You can only take a Prize from the Prize pile. You can take any Prize from the Prize pile; you do not have to take the top one. You can take a Duchy instead, whether or not the Prizes have run out. You can opt to take a Duchy even if the Duchy pile is empty, or a Prize even if no Prizes are left; in these cases you gain nothing. After gaining your card or not, if no other player revealed a Province, you draw a card and get +1 coin.

Las cartas de este mazo son de Perdición.</i>	 This card causes there to be an extra pile in the Supply, called the Bane pile; see Preparation. The extra pile is just like other Kingdom card piles - it can be bought, it can be gained via cards like Horn of Plenty, it counts for the end game condition. When you play Young Witch, after you draw 2 cards and discard 2 cards, each other player may reveal a Bane card from his hand; if he does not, he gains a Curse. This attack hits other players in turn order, which matters when the Curse pile is low. Players may still respond to a Young Witch with Reaction cards like Horse Traders or Moat (from Dominion); those happen before Bane cards are revealed. If Secret Chamber (from Dominion: Intrigue) is the Bane card, first you can reveal it for its Reaction ability, and then, if it's still in your hand, you can reveal it to avoid getting a Curse.

If there are not enough cards, reveal what you can, shuffle your discard pile, and reveal the rest. If there still are not 4 cards total to reveal, just reveal what you can.

This is a Treasure worth 0 coins. You play it in your Buy phase, like other Treasures. It does not produce any coins to spend. However, when you play it, you gain a card costing up to per differently named card you have in play. This includes itself, other played Treasures, played Actions, and any Duration cards (from Dominion: Seaside) played on your previous turn. It only counts cards currently in play, not ones that were in play but left; for example if you played a Feast (from Dominion) this turn, you will have trashed it, so it will not count for Horn of Plenty. The card you gain must come from the Supply, and is put into your discard pile. If it is a Victory card, trash Horn of Plenty. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Victory (such as Nobles from Dominion: Intrigue) are Victory cards. You do not have to play Horn of Plenty in your Buy phase, and you choose the order that you play Treasures. You do not trash Horn of Plenty if you gain a Victory card some other way while it's in play (such as by buying one).

Añade esa carta a tu mano y descarta las demás cartas del mazo reveladas.	 First you draw a card and get +1 Action. Then you reveal your hand, and reveal cards from your deck until revealing one that is not a duplicate of one in your hand. A card is not a duplicate of one in your hand if it does not have the same name as any cards in your hand. If you run out of cards while revealing cards, shuffle your discard pile (but not the revealed cards) and keep revealing cards. If you still do not find one, just discard all of the cards revealed from your deck. If you do find a card not matching any cards in your hand, put it into your hand and discard the other cards revealed from your deck.

Si se trata de una carta de Victoria, el jugador gana una Maldición. En cualquier otro caso, el jugador gana una copia de la carta descartada o la ganas tú (a elección tuya).	 Each player with no cards in his deck shuffles his discard pile in order to get a card to discard. If he still has no cards, he does not discard one. For each player who discarded a card, if it is a Victory card, he gains a Curse, and otherwise, you choose: either that player gains a copy of the card, or you do. The gained copies and Curses come from the Supply and are put into the discard piles of the players who gain them. If a card is revealed for which there are no copies in the Supply, no one gains a copy of it. This Attack hits other players in turn order, which can matter when some piles are low. A card with multiple types, one of which is Victory (such as Nobles from Dominion: Intrigue) is a Victory card.
166	es	Recinto Ferial	Victoria		Consigues <vp>2</vp> por cada 5 cartas con nombre diferente que tengas en tu mazo (redondeando hacia abajo).	 At the end of the game, this is worth 2 VP per 5 differently named cards in your deck, rounded down. So if you have 0-4 different cards, it is worth 0 VP; if you have 5-9, it is worth 2 VP; if you have 10-14, it is worth 4 VP; if you have 15-19, it is worth 6; and so on. By default there are only 17 differently named cards available in a game, but sometimes there may be more cards, such as via Young Witch's setup rule, or due to Tournament. Use 8 Fairgrounds in a game with 2 players, and 12 for a game with 3 or more players.

168	en	Stonemason	Acción		Trash a card from your hand.<br/>Gain 2 cards each costing less than it.<hr/>When you buy this, you may overpay for it.<br/>If you do, gain 2 Actions each costing the amount you overpaid.	 When you play this, trash a card from your hand, and gain two cards, each costing less than the card you trashed. Trashing a card is not optional. If you do not have any cards left in your hand to trash, you do not gain any cards. The two cards you gain can be different or the same. For example you could trash a Gold to gain a Duchy and a Silver. Gaining cards is not optional if you trashed a card. The gained cards come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile; if there are no cheaper cards in the Supply (for example if you trash a Copper), you do not gain any. If there is only one card in the Supply cheaper than the trashed card, you gain that one. The cards you gain are gained one at a time; this may matter with cards that do something when gained, such as Inn from Dominion: Hinterlands. When you buy this, you may choose to overpay for it. If you do, you gain two Action cards each costing exactly the amount you overpaid. The Action cards can be different or the same. For example, if you buy Stonemason for 6 Coins, you could gain two Heralds. The Action cards come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. If there are no cards with the appropriate cost in the Supply, you do not gain one. Overpaying with a Potion (from Dominion: Alchemy) will let you gain cards with Potion in the cost. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action (such as Great Hall from Dominion: Intrigue), are Action cards. If you choose not to overpay, you will not gain any cards from that ability; it is not possible to use it to gain Action cards costing 0 Coins.
169	en	Doctor	Acción		Name a card. Reveal the top 3 cards of your deck. Trash the matches.<br/>Put the rest back on top in any order.<hr/>When you buy this, you may overpay for it. For each <c>1</c> you overpaid, look at the top card of your deck; trash it, discard it, or put it back.	 When you play this, you name a card, reveal the top three cards of your deck, trash each of those cards that has that name, and put the other cards back on your deck in any order. You do not have to name a card being used this game. If there are fewer than three cards left in your deck, reveal the remaining cards, and shuffle your discard pile (which does not include those cards) to get the remainder needed to reveal. If there are still not enough cards, just reveal as many as you can. When you buy this, for each extra 1 Coin you pay over the cost, you look at the top card of your deck, and either trash it, discard it, or put it back on top. If there are no cards left in your deck, shuffle your discard pile into your deck (including any cards already discarded to this overpay ability this turn), and if there still are no cards in it, you do not look at one. If you overpay more than 1 Coin, you may do different things for each card you look at, and you will look at the same card again if you put it back on top. For example if you bought Doctor for 7 Coins, you would look at the top card four times; you might end up first trashing a Copper, then discarding a Province, then putting a Silver back on top, then putting that Silver back on top again.
170	en	Masterpiece	Tesoro		<big> <c>1</c> </big><hr/>When you buy this, you may overpay for it. If you do, gain a Silver per <c>1</c> you overpaid.	 This is a Treasure worth 1 Coin, like Copper.

If there are not three cards in your deck, reveal what you can, then shuffle your discard pile into your deck to get the other cards. If there still are not enough, just reveal what you can. No matter how many you revealed, the player to your left chooses one for you to discard, and the remaining cards go into your hand.
172	en	Plaza	Acción	Requiere: Marcador de Monedas	<b>+1 Card<br/>+2 Actions</b><br/><br/>You may discard a Treasure card. If you do, take a Coin token.	 First you draw a card and get +2 Actions; then you may discard a Treasure. You can discard the card you drew if it is a Treasure. If you discarded a Treasure card, you take a Coin token. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Treasure (such as Harem from Dominion: Intrigue), are Treasures.
173	en	Taxman	Acción Ataque		You may trash a Treasure from your hand. Each other player with 5 or more cards in hand discards a copy of it (or reveals a hand without it). Gain a Treasure card costing up to <c>3</c> more than the trashed card, putting it on top of your deck.	 You may trash a Treasure card from your hand. This is optional. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Treasure (like Harem from Dominion: Intrigue), are Treasures. If you do trash a Treasure, each other player with at least five cards in hand discards a copy of it from her hand if she can, or reveals a hand with no copies of it, and you gain a Treasure costing up to 3 Coins more than the trashed Treasure, putting it on top of your deck. If there are no cards in your deck, it becomes the only card in your deck. You do not have to gain a more expensive Treasure; you may gain a Treasure with the same cost, or a cheaper Treasure. You have to gain a card if you trashed one though, if possible. The gained Treasure comes from the Supply.
174	en	Herald	Acción		<b>+1 Card<br/>+1 Action</b><br/>Reveal the top card of your deck.<br/>If it is an Action, play it.<hr/>When you buy this, you may overpay for it. For each <c>1</c> you overpaid, look through your discard pile and put a card from it on top of your deck.	 When you play this, first draw a card and get +1 Action, then reveal the top card of your deck. If it is an Action card, play it; this is not optional. Playing the Action card does not "use up" one of your Action plays for the turn. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Action (such as Great Hall from Dominion: Intrigue), are Action cards. If Herald plays a Duration card (from Dominion: Seaside), the Herald is still discarded normally at end of turn, as it is not needed to track anything. When you buy this, you put one card from your discard pile on top of your deck for each extra 1 Coin you pay over the cost. For example, if you buy Herald for 6 Coins, you will put two cards from your discard pile on top of your deck. This card lets you look through your discard pile; normally you cannot. You cannot look through your discard pile first to see how much you want to overpay, and once you overpay you must put the appropriate number of cards on top of your deck if possible. If you overpay enough to put more cards on your deck than there are cards in your discard pile, you just put all of your discard pile onto your deck. You may not look through your discard pile if you buy Herald without overpaying for it. When you put multiple cards on your deck due to overpaying for a Herald, put them on your deck in any order. 
175	en	Baker	Acción	Requiere: Marcador de Monedas	<b>+1 Card<br/>+1 Action</b><br/>Take a Coin token.<hr/>Setup: Each player takes a Coin token.	 When you play this, you draw a card, get +1 Action, and take a Coin token. In games using this card, each player starts the game with a Coin token. This includes games using the promo card Black Market in which Baker is in the Black Market deck.
176	en	Butcher	Acción	Requiere: Marcador de Monedas	Take 2 Coin tokens. You may trash a card from your hand and then pay any number of Coin tokens. If you did trash a card, gain a card with a cost of up to the cost of the trashed card plus the number of Coin tokens you paid.	 First take two Coin tokens. Then you may trash a card from your hand and pay any number of Coin tokens (returning them to the pile). The number of Coin tokens you pay can be zero. Butcher itself is no longer in your hand and so cannot trash itself (though it can trash another copy of Butcher). If you trashed a card, you gain a card costing up to the cost of the trashed card plus the number of Coin tokens you paid. For example, you could trash an Estate and pay six Coin tokens to gain a Province, or you could trash another Butcher and pay zero Coin tokens to gain a Duchy. You can pay the Coin tokens you just got. Paying Coin tokens for this ability does not get you coins to spend, it just changes what cards you can gain with this ability.
177	en	Journeyman	Acción		Name a card. Reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal 3 cards that are not the named card. Put those cards into your hand and discard the rest.	 This draws you three cards that are not a particular card. First name a card. It does not have to be a card being used this game. Then reveal cards from the top of your deck until you have revealed three cards that are not the named card. If you run out of cards without finding three, shuffle your discard pile into your deck and continue. If you still cannot find three, stop. Put the cards you found that were not the named card into your hand and discard the rest.
178	en	Merchant Guild	Acción	Requiere: Marcador de Monedas	<b>+1 Buy<br/>+<c>1</c></b><hr/>While this is in play, when you buy a card, take a Coin token.	 When you play this, you get +1 Buy and +1 Coin. While this is in play, any time you buy a card you also take a Coin token. Remember that you may only spend Coin tokens prior to buying cards, so you will not be able to immediately spend that Coin token. This ability is cumulative; if you have two Merchant Guilds in play, each card you buy will get you two Coin tokens. However if you play a Merchant Guild multiple times but only have one in play, such as with Throne Room (from Dominion) or King's Court (from Dominion: Prosperity), you will only get one Coin token when you buy a card.
179	en	Soothsayer	Acción Ataque	Requiere: Maldición	Gain a Gold. Each other player gains a Curse. Each player who did draws a card.	 The Gold and Curses come from the Supply and go into discard piles. If there is no Gold left, you do not gain one. If there are not enough Curses left to go around, deal them out in turn order, starting with the player to your left. Each player who gained a Curse draws a card. This is not optional. A player who did not gain a Curse, whether due to the Curses running out or due to some other reason, does not draw a card. A player who uses Watchtower (from Dominion: Prosperity) to trash the Curse did gain a Curse and so draws a card; a player who uses Trader (from Dominion: Hinterlands) to gain a Silver instead did not gain a Curse and so does not draw a card.
180	es	Encrucijada	Acción		Revela tu mano.<br/><b>+1 Carta</b> por cada carta de Victoria revelada. Si se trata de la primera vez en este turno que juegas una Encrucijada, <b>+3 Acciones</b>.	 First reveal your hand, and draw a card for each Victory card you revealed, if any. The revealed cards all stay in your hand. Cards with two types, one of which is Victory, are Victory cards. Then, if this is the first time you played a Crossroads this turn, you get +3 Actions. Subsequent Crossroads this turn will give you cards but not Actions. Using a card that lets you play a card several times (like Throne Room from Dominion) on Crossroads, you will play Crossroads multiple times, getting +3 Actions the first time but not the others.
181	es	Duquesa	Acción		<b>+<c>2</c></b><br/>Cada jugador mira la carta superior de su mazo y la descarta o la devuelve de nuevo a su mazo.<hr/>Si esta carta forma parte del Suministro, cada vez que ganes un Ducado, puedes ganar además una Duquesa.	 When you play this, you get +2 coins, and each player, including you, looks at the top card of his own deck and either discards it or puts it back on top, his choice. Any player with no cards in his deck shuffles his discard pile first; any player who still has no cards to look at does not look at one. When a player gains a Duchy in a game with Duchess in the Supply, that player may also gain a Duchess from the Supply. This works whether the player gained a Duchy due to buying one, or gained a Duchy some other way. Duchess does not interact in any special way with the promotional card Black Market.

En cualquier otro caso, su valor será <c>4</c>.<hr/>Cuando otro jugador gane una Provincia, puedes eliminar esta carta de tu mano. Si lo haces, ganas una carta de Oro y la colocas encima de tu mazo.	 This is both a Treasure and a Reaction. It can be played in your Buy phase like other Treasures. When you play it, it is worth 1 coin if this is the first time you played a Fool's Gold this turn, and otherwise it is worth 4 coins. So if your lay three Fool's Golds in the same turn, the first is worth 1 coin, the second is worth 4 coins, and the third is worth 4 coins. Fool's Gold is also a Reaction. When another player gains a Province, you may trash Fool's Gold from your hand; if you do, you gain a Gold from the Supply, putting it on top of your deck rather than into your discard pile. If there are no cards in your deck, the Gold becomes the only card in your deck. If there are no Gold cards left in the Supply, you do not gain one, but can still trash Fool's Gold. This Reaction is only usable when another player gains a Province, not you. It is usable whether a Province was gained due to being bought, or gained some other way.

Coloca las dos cartas ganadas en la parte superior de tu mazo, en el orden que quieras.	 First trash a card from your hand, if you have any cards in hand. Develop itself is no longer in your hand and so cannot trash itself (though it can trash other copies of Develop). If you trashed a card, gain two cards, one costing exactly 1 coin more than the trashed card, and one costing exactly 1 coin less than the trashed card. The gained cards come from the Supply; gain them in either order. If there is no card in the Supply at one of the costs, you still gain the other card if you can. Put the gained cards on top of your deck rather than into your discard pile. If you trash a Copper with Develop, which costs 0 coins, you will try and fail to gain a card costing -1 coins (and also try to gain a card costing 1 coin).
184	es	Oasis	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción<br/>+<c>1</c></b><br/>Descarta una carta.	 You draw before discarding. You can discard the card you drew.

A player putting the cards back puts them back in an order he chooses, and without needing to reveal that order. Then, you draw two cards. So if you put back the cards you revealed, you will draw them.
186	es	Confabulación	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+1 Acción</b><br/><br/>Al comienzo de tu Fase de Mantenimiento de este turno, puedes elegir una carta de Acción que tengas en juego y que vayas a descartar en este turno. En lugar de descartarla, colócala sobre tu mazo.	 When you play this, you draw a card, get +1 Action, and set up an effect to happen later in the turn, at the start of Clean- up. At that time, you may optionally choose an Action card you have in play. If you discard that Action card from play this turn, as you normally do, you will put it on top of your deck. This happens before you draw cards for next turn. The Action card you choose can be Scheme itself, or any other Action card you have in play, which might have been played before or after you played Scheme. If the Action card is not discarded during Clean- up, for example due to being a Duration card from Dominion: Seaside that was played this turn, then it does not get put on top of your deck.
187	es	Túnel	Victoria Reacción		<big> <vp>2</vp> </big><hr/>Al descartar esta carta por cualquier motivo que no sea en la Fase de Mantenimiento, puedes enseñarla. Si lo haces, ganas una carta de Oro.	 This is both a Victory card and a Reaction. At the end of the game, Tunnel is worth 2 victory points. Tunnel's Reaction ability functions when you discard it. You cannot simply choose to discard it; something has to let you or make you discard it. This ability functions whether you discard Tunnel on your own turn (such as due to Oasis) or on someone else's (such as due to Margrave). It functions if Tunnel is discarded from your hand (such as due to Oasis) or from your deck, or when set aside (such as due to Cartographer). If Tunnel would normally not necessarily be revealed (such as when discarding multiple cards to Cartographer), you have to reveal it to get the Gold. Revealing it is optional, even if Tunnel was already revealed for some other reason; you are not forced to gain a Gold. This ability does not function if cards are put into your discard pile without being discarded, such as when you buy a card, when you gain a card directly (such as with Border Village), when your deck is put into your discard pile, such as with Chancellor from Dominion, or with Possession from Dominion: Alchemy, when trashed cards are returned to you at end of turn. It also does not function during Clean-up, when you normally discard all of your played and unplayed cards. The key thing to look for is a card actually telling you to "discard" cards. The Gold you gain comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile; if there is no Gold left in the Supply, you do not gain one. 
188	es	Chico para Todo	Acción		Gana una carta de Plata.<br/>Mira la carta superior de tu mazo: descártala o colócala de nuevo sobre tu mazo.<br/>Roba cartas hasta tener 5 cartas en la mano. Puedes eliminar una carta de tu mano que no sea un Tesoro.	 This card does four separate things, in the order listed; you do all of them (the last one is optional). First, gain a Silver from the Supply, putting it into your discard pile. If there are no Silvers left in the Supply, you do not gain one. Second, look at the top card of your deck, and either discard it or put it back on top. If there are no cards left in your deck, shuffle your discard pile to get a card to look at (this will shuffle in the Silver you just gained). If there are still no cards, you do not look at one. Third, draw cards until you have at least five cards in hand. If you already have five or more cards in hand, you do not draw any cards. If there are not enough cards left to draw between your deck and discard pile, just draw what you can. Fourth, you may trash a card from your hand that is not a Treasure card. Cards with two types, one of which is Treasure, are Treasures.
189	es	Bandido Honrado	Acción Ataque		<b>+<c>1</c></b><br/>Cuando compres esta carta o la pongas en juego, cada jugador (menos tú) revela las 2 cartas superiores de su mazo, elimina una carta de Oro o Plata (a tu elección) que haya revelado y descarta el resto. Quien no revele ningún Tesoro, gana un Cobre. Tú ganas todas las cartas eliminadas.	 When you play this, you get +1 coin. When you play this and also when you buy it, each other player reveals the top two cards of his deck, trashes a Silver or Gold he revealed that you choose, and discards the rest. Each of these players that did not reveal a Treasure at all gains a Copper from the Supply, putting it into his discard pile. Finally, you gain all of the Silvers and Golds trashed this way. This cannot trash any Treasures except Silver or Gold. Gaining a Noble Brigand without buying it does not cause this ability to happen. Noble Brigand is an Attack card, and when you play it, players can use cards like Moat from Dominion or Secret Chamber from Intrigue in response. However, buying a Noble Brigand is not "playing an Attack card," and so cads like Moat cannot respond to that. 
190	es	Campamento Nómada	Acción		<b>+1 Compra<br/>+<c>2</c><hr/>Cuando ganes esta carta, colócala en la parte superior de tu mazo.	 When you gain this card, it goes on top of your deck rather than into your discard pile. This is true whether you gained it due to buying it or gained it some other way. If there were no cards in your deck, it becomes the only card in your deck.
191	es	Ruta de la Seda	Victoria		Consigues <vp>1</vp> por cada 4 cartas de Victoria que tengas en tu mazo (redondeando hacia abajo).	 This is a Victory card, not an Action card. It does nothing until the end of the game, when it is worth 1 victory point for every four Victory cards in your Deck (counting all of your cards - your Discard pile and hand are part of your Deck at that point). Silk Roads count themselves. Round down; if you have 11 Victory cards, Silk Road is worth 2 victory points. During set-up, put all 12 Silk Roads in the Supply for a game with 3 or more players, but only 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game. Cards with multiple types, one of which is Victory, are Victory cards and so are counted by Silk Road.

193	es	Comerciante	Acción Reacción		Elimina una carta de tu mano. Gana tantas cartas de Plata como el coste en monedas de la carta eliminada.<hr/>Cuando fueras a ganar una carta, puedes enseñar esta carta de tu mano para ganar, en su lugar, una carta de Plata.	 When you play this, trash a card from your hand, and if you did, gain a number of Silvers equal to the cost of that card in coins. The Silvers come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. If there are not enough Silvers left, just gain all of the Silvers that you can. You only gain Silvers if you trashed a card. If you trash a card costing 0 coins, such as Copper, you will gain zero Silvers. You can trash Silver if you want; you will gain three Silvers for it normally. If costs are different, such as due to playing Highway, then Trader will give you a different number of Silvers, based on the current costs. For example ifyou play Highway and then Trader, trashing an Estate you will only gain one Silver. If you trash a card with Potion in its cost from Dominion: Alchemy, you do not get anything for the Potion, just for the coins that the card cost. Trader is also a Reaction. When you gain a card, whether due to buying it or due to gaining it some other way, you may reveal Trader from your hand to instead gain a Silver from the Supply. If you do this, you gain a Silver, not the card you would have gained; if something would have happened due to gaining the other card, it does not happen, because you did not gain it. For example if you buy Ill-Gotten Gains but use Trader to gain Silver instead, no-one will gain a Curse. However if something happens when you buy a card, that will still happen if you replace gaining the card with gaining Silver. For example you can buy Farmland, trash a card from your hand and gain one costing 2 more, then use Trader to gain Silver rather than Farmland. If the card you were going to gain was not going to your discard pile, the Silver still goes to your discard pile; if the card you were going to gain did not come from the Supply, the Silver still comes from the Supply. If there are no Silvers left in the Supply, you can still reveal Trader when you gain a card; you gain nothing instead of the card you would have gained.
194	es	Hallazgo	Tesoro		<big> <c>3</c> </big><hr/>Cuando ganes esta carta, gana además 2 cartas de Cobre.	 This is a treasure worth 3 coins, like Gold. When you gain it, you also gain two Coppers from the Supply. if there are not two Coppers left, just gain as many as you can. You only gain Coppers when you gain Cache, not when you play it. You gain Coppers whether you gained Cache due to buying it, or gained it some other way.

De esas 4 cartas, descarta las que quieras y devuelve las demás a la parte superior de tu mazo, en el orden que quieras.	 You draw a card first, then look at the top 4 cards of your deck. If there are fewer than 4 cards left in your deck, look at the remaining cards, and shuffle your discard pile (which does not include those cards) to get the remainder needed to look at. If there are still not enough cards, just look at as many as you can. Discard any number of the cards you looked at - none, all four, or something in-between - and put the rest back on top of your deck in any order. if there were no cards left in your deck, these become the only cards in your deck. You do not reveal the cards you put back.
196	es	Embajada	Acción		<b>+5 Cartas</b><br/>Descarta 3 cartas.<hr/>Cuando ganes esta carta, cada jugador (menos tú) gana una carta de Plata.	 When you play this, you draw five cards, then discard three cards. The cards you discard can be ones that were in your hand and/or ones you just drew. You discard three cards if able, even if you were unable to draw the full five cards (due to not having enough cards in your deck and discard pile). If you do not have three cards to discard, you discard as many as you can. When you gain this, each other player gains a Silver. Players only gain Silvers when you gain this, not when you play this. They gain Silvers whether you gained Embassy due to buying it, or gained it some other way. Gaining Silvers is not optional for them. The Silvers come from the Supply. If there are not enough Silvers left to go around, deal them out in turn order, starting with the player to the left of the player who gained Embassy.
197	es	Regateador	Acción		<b>+<c>2</c></b><hr/>Mientras esta carta esté en juego, cada vez que compres una carta, ganas otra carta (que no sea de Victoria) con un coste inferior al de la carta comprada.	 When you play this, you get +2 coins. While this is in play, whenever you buy a card, you gain a cheaper card that is not a Victory card. For example, you could buy a Province, and gain a Gold via Haggler. Gaining a card is not optional. The gained card comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. Haggler only gives you an extra card when you buy a card, not when you gain a card some other way (such as with Haggler itself). If there is no cheaper card available in the Supply (e.g., if you buy a Copper), you do not gain a card. Using a card that lets you play a card several times (like Throne Room from Dominion) on Haggler does not gain you two or more cards per card bought, as there is still only one copy of Haggler in play. The bonus is cumulative if you have three Hagglers in play, you will gain three more cards for each card you buy. Cards with two types, one of which is Victory, are Victory cards and so cannot be gained with Haggler.

When it leaves play, it stops making cards cheaper This applies to cards everywhere - cards in the Supply, cards in hand, cards in Decks. For example if you played Highway, then Develop, trashing a Copper, you could gain an Estate, as Estate would cost 4 coins while Copper would still cost 0 coins. Using a card that lets you play a card several times (like Throne Room from Dominion) on Highway will not make cards cost less, as there is still only one copy of Highway in play. The bonus is cumulative; if you have three Highways in play, all cards cost 1 coins less (to a minimum of 0 coins).
199	es	Dinero Sucio	Tesoro	Requiere: Maldición	<big> <c>1</c> </big><br/><br/>Cuando pongas en juego esta carta, puedes ganar una carta de Cobre y añadirla a tu mano.<hr/>Cuando ganes esta carta, cada jugador (menos tú) gana una Maldición.	 This is a Treasure worth 2 coins like Copper. When you play it, you may gain a Copper. The gained Copper comes from the Supply and is put into your hand; you can immediately play it. If there is no Copper left in the Supply, you do not gain one. When you gain Ill-Gotten Gains, each other player gains a Curse. This happens whether you gain Ill-Gotten Gains due to buying it, or you gain it some other way. The Curses come from the Supply and go into discard piles. If there are not enough Curses left to go around, deal them out in turn order, starting with the player to the left of the player who gained Ill-Gotten Gains. III-Gotten Gains is not an Attack, and gaining it is not playing an Attack; cards like Moat from Dominion do not work against it.
200	es	Posada	Acción		<b>+2 Cartas<br/>+2 Acciones</b><br/>Descarta 2 cartas.<hr/>Cuando ganes esta carta, busca en tu pila de descartes (incluyendo esta carta), revela cualquier número de cartas de Acción de ella y barájalas con las cartas de tu mazo.	 When you play this, you draw 2 cards, get +2 Actions, then discard 2 cards. The cards you discard can be ones that were in your hand and/or ones you just drew. You discard cards if able, even if you were unable to draw 2 cards. When you gain this, you look through your discard pile (something normally not allowed) and shuffle any number of Action cards from it into your deck (leaving the rest of your discard pile in your discard pile). You do not have to shuffle any Action cards into your deck. You can shuffle the Inn you just gained into your deck; it is an Action card in your discard pile. Cards with two types, one of which is Action, are Action cards. You must reveal the Action cards that you choose to shuffle into your deck. It does not matter what order you leave your discard pile in afterwards. This ability functions if you gain Inn due to buying it, or gain Inn some other way.
201	es	Mandarín	Acción		<b>+<c>3</c></b><br/>Pon una carta de tu mano encima de tu mazo.<hr/>Cuando ganes esta carta, coloca todos los Tesoros que tengas en juego encima de tu mazo, en el orden que quieras.	 When you play this, you get +3 coins, and put a card from your hand on top of your deck. If you have no cards left in hand, you do not put a card on top of your deck. If there are no cards left in your deck, the card you put on top becomes the only card in your deck. When you gain this, you put all of your Treasures from play on top of your deck in any order. You do not have to show this order to other players. You have to put all of your Treasures on top; you cannot leave some out. You only put Treasures from play on top of your deck, not unplayed Treasures from your hand. This does not stop you from having the coins you got from playing those Treasures; for example, if you have +1 Buy and play four Golds and buy a Mandarin, you put the Golds on top of your deck, and still have 7 coins left to spend. Mandarin puts your played Treasures on your deck whether you gained it due to buying it or gained it some other way, although normally you will only have Treasures in play in your Buy phase.
202	es	Margrave	Acción Ataque		<b>+3 Cartas<br/>+1 Compra</b><br/><br/>Cada jugador (menos tú) roba una carta y luego se descarta hasta quedarse con 3 cartas en la mano.	 You draw 3 cards and get +1 Buy. Each other player draws a card, then discards down to 3 cards in hand. Drawing a card is not optional for them. A player who only has 3 cards or fewer after drawing does not discard.
203	es	Caballerizas	Acción		Puedes descartar un Tesoro de tu mano. Si lo haces, <b>+3 Cartas y +1 Acción.</b>	 You may discard a Treasure card from your hand. This is optional. If you did discard one, you get +3 Cards and +1 Action. You draw after discarding, so if you have to shuffle to get the 3 cards, you will end up shuffling in the card you discarded.
204	es	Pueblo Fronterizo	Acción		<b>+1 Carta<br/>+2 Acciones</b><hr/>Cuando ganes esta carta, gana además otra carta que tenga un coste inferior a ésta.	 When you play this, you draw a card and can play two more Actions this turn. When you gain this, you also gain a card from the Supply that costs less than Border Village. Normally that will be a card costing up to 5 coins, but if Border Village costs less than normal, such as due to Highway, then the card you gain will have a lower maximum cost. You only gain a card when you gain Border Village, not when you play it. You gain a card whether you gained Border Village due to buying it, or gained it some other way.
205	es	Tierra de Labranza	Victoria		<big> <vp>2</vp> </big><hr/>Cuando compres esta carta, elimina una carta de tu mano y gana una carta que cueste exactamente <c>2</c> más que la carta eliminada.	 This is a Victory card, not an Action card. It is worth 2 victory points at the end of the game. When you buy it, you trash a card from your hand if able, and if you did, you gain a card from the supply costing exactly 2 coins more than the trashed card if able. If there are no cards left in your hand to trash, you do not trash or gain a card, and if you trashed a card but there are no cards in the supply costing exactly 2 coins more than the trashed card, you do not gain a card. This ability only functions when you buy Farmland, not when you gain it some other way. During set-up, put all 12 Farmlands in the Supply for a game with 3 or more players, but only 8 in the Supply for a 2-player game.
206	es	Príncipe	Acción		Puedes apartar esta carta aun lado. Si lo haces; aparta una carta de Acción de tu mano con un coste de <c>4</c> o menos. Al principio de cada uno de tus turnos juega esa Acción, colocándola a un lado de nuevo cuando la fueras a descartar del juego (Deja de jugar esta carta si no puedes apartar la otra carta de Acción apartada inicialmente junto a esta).	 Prince has you play the same cheap action every turn for the rest of the game. The turn you play Prince, you set it aside with an Action from your hand costing 4 coins or less; then every turn after that you play the Action at the start of the turn, and then set it aside again when you discard it from play. If you don't discard the Action then you stop playing it with Prince; Prince at that point is just set aside doing nothing for the rest of the game. That won't normally happen but will happen for example if the Action is a Feast or Mining Village and you trashed it, or if it's a Duration card and so it stayed in play, or if it's a Madman and was returned to its pile, or if it's an Island and was set aside, or if it's a card you put back on your deck with Scheme. The set aside Action technically goes back and forth from being in play to being set aside each turn, but in practice it's easier to leave it sitting on the Prince and just announce resolving it each turn.
207	en	Coin of the Realm	Treasure Reserve		<big> <c>1</c> </big><br/><br/>When you play this, put it on your Tavern mat.<hr/>Directly after resolving an Action, you may call this, for +2 Actions.	 This is a Treasure worth 1 Coin. You play it in your Buy phase, like other Treasures. When you play it, it goes on your Tavern mat. It produces 1 Coin that turn but is no longer in play. It stays on the mat until you call it. You can call it after resolving playing an Action card, for +2 Actions (which will let you play further Action cards). Move the Coin of the Realm into play when you call it, but it does not give you 1 Coin that turn, it just gives +2 Actions. It is discarded that turn with your other cards in play.
208	en	Page	Action Viajero	Requiere: Upgrades	<b>+1 Card<br/>+1 Action</b><hr/>When you discard this from play, you may exchange it for a Treasure Hunter.	 See the section on Travelers. When you play Page, you get +1 Card and +1 Action. When you discard it from play, you may return it to its pile and take a Treasure Hunter, putting it into your discard pile.
209	en	Peasant	Action Viajero	Requiere: Upgrades, All +1 Tokens	<b>+1 Buy<br/>+<c>1</c></b><hr/>When you discard this from play, you may exchange it for a Soldier.	 See the section on Travelers. When you play Peasant, you get +1 Buy and + 1 Coin. When you discard it from play, you may return it to its pile and take a Soldier, putting it into your discard pile.
210	en	Ratcatcher	Acción Reserva		<b>+1 Card<br/>+1 Action</b><br/>Put this on your Tavern mat.<hr/>At the start of your turn, you may call this to trash a card from your hand.	 When you play this, you get +1 Card and +1 Action, and put it on your Tavern mat. It stays on your mat until you call it at the start of one of your turns. If multiple things can happen at the start of your turn, you can do them in any order. When you call Ratcatcher, you move it from the mat into play, and you trash a card from your hand. Ratcatcher is discarded that turn with your other cards in play.
211	en	Raze	Acción		<b>+1 Action</b><br/><br/>Trash this or a card from your hand. Look at a number of cards from the top of your deck equal to the cost in <c/> of the trashed card. Put one into your hand and discard the rest.	 If you trash a card costing 0 Coins with this, you do not get any cards. If you trash a card costing 1 Coin or more, you look at a number of cards from the top of your deck equal to the cost in Coins of the trashed card, take one into your hand, and discard the rest. For example if you trash an Estate, you look at the top two cards of your deck, put one into your hand, and discard the other one. You can trash the Raze itself; normally it costs 2 Coins, so you would look at two cards. Costs may be affected by cards like Bridge Troll. Raze is unaffected by the -1 Card token; if it is on top of your deck, replace it after resolving Raze.
212	en	Amulet	Acción Duración		Now and at the start of your next turn, choose one: +<c>1</c>; or trash a card from your hand; or gain a Silver.	 You choose something when you play it, and again at the start of your next turn; the choices may be the same or different.
213	en	Caravan Guard	Acción Duración Reacción		<b>+1 Card<br/>+1 Action</b><br/>At the start of your next turn, +<c>1</c>.<hr/>When another player plays an Attack card, you may play this from your hand.<br/><i>(+1 Action has no effect if it's not your turn.)</i>	 This gives you +1 Card and +1 Action when you play it, and then + 1 Coin at the start of your next turn after that. This card has a Reaction ability that lets you play it when another player plays an Attack card. Playing this during another player's turn is similar to playing it during your own turn - you put Caravan Guard into play, get +1 Card and +1 Action, and will get + 1 Coin at the start of your next turn - the very next turn you take. However getting +1 Action during someone else's turn does not do anything for you; it does not let you play other Action cards during that player’s turn. Similarly if a token gives you + 1 Coin or +1 Buy during another player's turn, that still does not let you buy cards during that player’s turn (although + 1 Coin can cancel the - token given out by Bridge Troll). The +1 Action (or potential other +'s) does not carry over to your next turn either. After reacting with a Caravan Guard, you can use another one, even one you just drew, and also can use other Reactions, even ones you just drew; you keep going until you have no more Reactions you wish to respond to the Attack with.
214	en	Dungeon	Acción Duración		<b>+1 Action</b><br/><br/>Now and at the start of your next turn: +2 Cards, then discard 2 cards.	 When you play this, you get +1 Action, draw 2 cards, and discard 2 cards; then at the start of your next turn, you again draw 2 cards and discard 2 cards.
215	en	Gear	Acción Duración		<b>+2 Cards</b><br/><br/>Set aside up to 2 cards from your hand face down. At the start of your next turn, put them into your hand.	 You may set aside zero, one, or two cards from your hand. Put them face down under the Gear; you may look at them. They do not have to be cards you drew with Gear. If you set aside zero cards, Gear will be discarded the same turn you played it; if you set aside one or two cards, you put them into your hand at the start of your next turn, and Gear is discarded at the end of that turn.

When you play this, you get +1 Card and +1 Action, and put it on your Tavern mat. It stays on your mat until you call it at the start of one of your turns. If multiple things can happen at the start of your turn, you can do them in any order. When you call Guide, it moves from the mat into play, and you discard your hand, then draw 5 cards. You discard it that turn with your other cards in play.

When you play this, you put it on your Tavern mat. It stays on your mat until you call it. You can call it when gaining a card costing up to 6 Coins , and gain another copy of that card. The gained card comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile; Duplicate cannot gain non-supply cards such as Teacher. Duplicate can be called during other players' turns when you gain cards; for example, another player might buy Messenger and choose to have each player gain an Estate, and you could Duplicate that Estate. You can call multiple Duplicates to gain multiple copies of the same card. Duplicate is discarded during the Clean-up of the turn you call it, whether or not it is your turn.
218	en	Magpie	Acción		<b>+1 Card<br/>+1 Action</b><br/><br/>Reveal the top card of your deck. If it's a Treasure, put it into your hand. If it's an Action or Victory card, gain a Magpie.	 If the top card of your deck is a Treasure, it goes into your hand. If the card is not a Treasure, leave it on top of your deck. If the card is an Action card or Victory card, you gain a Magpie; once the Magpie pile is empty, revealing an Action or Victory card will not get you anything. If you reveal a Harem (from Intrigue), you both put it into your hand and gain a Magpie, since it is both a Treasure and a Victory card.
219	en	Messenger	Acción		<b>+1 Buy<br/>+<c>2</c></b><br/>You may put your deck into your discard pile.<hr/>When this is your first buy in a turn, gain a card costing up to <c>4</c>, and each other player gains a copy of it.	 When you play this, you get +1 Buy, + 2 Coin , and may optionally put your deck into your discard pile. This is not discarding cards and does not trigger Tunnel (from Hinterlands). When you buy Messenger, if it is the first thing you bought that turn (card or Event), you gain a card costing up to 4 Coins from the Supply, putting it into your discard pile, and then each other player in turn order also gains a copy of that card. If the Supply runs out of copies of the card, further players do not get anything.

You may choose to put a Copper from your hand on your mat even if you have no Coppers in hand; nothing will happen. You may also choose to get + 1 Coin per Copper on your mat if there are no Coppers on your mat; nothing will happen. Putting a Copper from your hand on your mat is not trashing it; Coppers on your mat are not in play, but count as part of your deck when scoring at the end.
221	en	Port	Acción		<b>+1 Card<br/>+2 Actions</b><hr/>When you buy this, gain another Port.	 When you buy a Port, you gain another Port. If you gain a Port some other way, you do not get an extra Port. There are 12 Ports in the pile; use all 12.

At the start of the game, place your Journey token (the one with the boot) face up. When you play this, you get +1 Buy, and turn the token over. Then if it is face down, nothing more happens. If it is face up, you draw 5 cards. So, every other time you play a Ranger, you will draw 5 cards. It does not matter what turned over the Journey token; you could turn it face down with Giant, then face up with Ranger.
223	en	Transmogrify	Acción Reserva		<b>+1 Action</b><br/>Put this on your Tavern mat.<hr/>At the start of your turn, you may call this, to trash a card from your hand, gain a card costing up to <c>1</c> more than it, and put that card into your hand.	 When you play this, you get +1 Action and put it on your Tavern mat. It stays on your mat until you call it, at the start of one of your turns. If multiple things can happen at the start of your turn, you can do them in any order. When you call Transmogrify, it moves from the mat into play, and you trash a card from your hand, then gain a card costing up to 1 Coin more than the trashed card. The gained card comes from the Supply and is put into your hand; if you had no cards to trash, you do not gain one. Transmogrify is discarded that turn with your other cards in play. You may trash a card to gain a card costing 1 Coin more, or the same amount, or less; you may trash a card to gain a copy of the same card.
224	en	Artificer	Acción		<b>+1 Card<br/>+1 Action<br/>+<c>1</c></b><br/>Discard any number of cards.<br/>You may gain a card costing exactly <c>1</c> per card discarded, putting it on top of your deck.

For example if you discarded two cards; you may gain a card costing 2 ; if you discard no cards, you may gain a card costing 0. The gained card comes from the Supply and is put on top of your deck. You may choose not to gain a card, even if you discard cards.
225	en	Bridge Troll	Acción Ataque Duración	Requiere: -1 Coin Token	Each other player takes his -<c>1</c> token. Now and at the start of your next turn:<br/><b>+1 Buy</b><hr/>While this is in play, cards cost <c>1</c> less on your turns, but not less than <c>0</c>.	 This gives each other player his - 1 Coin token, which will cause those players to get 1 Coin less the next time they get treasure; see the Tokens section. It also gives you +1 Buy both on the turn you play it and on your next turn. While Bridge Troll is in play, on your turns only, cards cost 1 Coin less, but not less than 0 Coins. This applies to all cards everywhere, including cards in the Supply, cards in hand, and cards in Decks. For example if you have Bridge Troll in play and play Raze, trashing Estate, Estate will only cost 1 Coin, so you'll only look at one card rather than two. This is cumulative; if you have two Bridge Trolls in play from last turn and play another Bridge Troll this turn, all cards will cost 3 Coins less this turn (to a minimum of 0 Coins).
226	en	Distant Lands	Acción Reserva Victoria		Put this on your Tavern mat.<hr/>Worth <vp>4</vp> if on your Tavern mat at the end of the game (otherwise worth <vp>0</vp>).	 This is a Victory card. Use 8 for games with 2 players, or 12 for games with 3 or more players. This is also an Action card; when you play it, you put it on your Tavern mat. It will stay there the rest of the game; there is no way to call it. At the end of the game, Distant Lands is worth 4 Victory Points if it is on your mat, or 0 Victory Points if it is not.

If it's face up, +<c>5</c>, and each other player reveals the top card of his deck, trashes it if it costs from <c>3</c> to <c>6</c>, and otherwise discards it and gains a Curse.	 At the start of the game, place your Journey token (the one with the boot) face up. When you play this, you turn the Journey token over. Then, if it is face down, you get + 1 Coin and nothing more happens. If it is face up, you get + 5 Coins and the attack part happens. The attack resolves in turn order, starting with the player to your left. The player reveals the top card of his deck, and either trashes it if it costs from 3 to 6 Coins, or discards it and gains a Curse otherwise. Cards with in the cost (from Alchemy) do not cost from 3 to 6 Coins. Cards with an asterisk or + by the cost that cost from 3 to 6 Coins (such as Teacher, or Masterpiece from Guilds) do get trashed. Players can respond to Giant being played with Reactions that respond to Attacks (such as Caravan Guard), even if Giant will only be producing + 1 Coin this time.

A player may not have any cards left in hand when buying a card; typically cards left in hand will include Victory cards, Curses, and unplayed Actions. A player may intentionally avoid playing Treasures and Actions in order to take advantage of having to put his hand on his deck. Players who do not buy any cards can discard their hand normally. Buying Events is not buying cards and so does not trigger this. If you play Haunted Woods and then take an extra turn immediately, such as with Mission or Outpost (from Seaside), you will draw the 3 cards at the start of that turn and discard Haunted Woods that turn, and other players will never be affected by it. If you want to use a Reaction card like Moat against Haunted Woods, you have to use it right when Haunted Woods is played.

Relic is an Attack despite not being an Action; it can be blocked with Moat and responded to with Caravan Guard and so on. A player responding to Relic with Caravan Guard first plays Caravan Guard, including drawing a card, and then puts his -1 Card token on his deck.

Royal Carriage cannot respond to Actions that are no longer in play, such as a Reserve card that was put on the Tavern mat, or a card that trashed itself (like a Raze used to trash itself). When called, Royal Carriage causes you to replay the card you just played. You can call multiple Royal Carriages to replay the same Action multiple times (provided the Action is still in play). You completely resolve the Action before deciding whether or not to use Royal Carriage on it. If you use Royal Carriage to replay a Duration card, Royal Carriage will stay in play until the Duration card is discarded from play, to track the fact that the Duration card has been played twice.

For example if you had 4 Coins, you lose the 4 Coins and draw 4 cards. This makes you lose all Coins you have so far that turn, including the Coins you get from playing the Treasures, the + 1 Coin Storyteller gives you directly, and any you made earlier in the turn. You can track that the Treasures have been "spent" by putting them under the Storyteller. Potions, produced by Potions from Alchemy, is not Coin and so is not lost and does not get you any cards.

Players who buy multiple cards will gain a Curse per card bought; players who do not buy any cards will not get any Curses. This is cumulative; if you play two Swamp Hags, and the player after you plays one, then the player after that will get three Curses with any card bought. This does not affect cards gained other ways, only bought cards. Buying Events is not buying cards and so does not trigger this. If you play Swamp Hag and then take an extra turn immediately, such as with Mission or Outpost (from Seaside), you will get + 3 Coins at the start of that turn and discard Swamp Hag that turn, and other players will never be affected by it.

When you do, you get +1 Buy (letting you buy another Event or a card afterwards), set aside a card from your hand face down (the other players do not get to see it), and put it into your hand at the end of the turn, after drawing your hand for the next turn. For example you might set aside an unplayed Copper, and then after drawing your 5 cards for next turn, add the Copper to your hand.
241	en	Scouting Party	Evento		<b>+1 Buy</b><br/>Look at the top 5 cards of your deck. Discard 3 of them and put the rest back on top of your deck in any order.	 When you buy this you get +1 Buy (letting you buy another Event or a card afterwards). Then look at the top 5 cards of your deck, discarding 3 and putting the rest on top of your deck in any order. If there are fewer than 5 cards even after shuffling, you still discard 3 of them; if there are only 3 cards left between your deck and discard pile, all 3 will be discarded. Scouting Party is unaffected by the -1 Card token; if it is on top of your deck, replace it after resolving Scouting Party.
242	en	Travelling Fair	Evento		<b>+2 Buys</b><br/>When you gain a card this turn, you may put it on top of your deck.	 When you buy this, you get +2 Buys (letting you buy more Events or cards afterwards). Then for the rest of the turn, whenever you gain a card, you may put it on your deck. This works on cards you buy, as well as cards gained other ways, such as gaining cards with Ball. It does not work on Travelers exchanged for other cards; exchanging is not gaining. Putting the card on your deck is optional each time you gain a card that turn; you could put some on top and let the others go to your discard pile.
243	en	Bonfire	Evento		Trash up to 2 cards you have in play.	 This only trashes cards you have in play, not cards from your hand. You can trash zero, one, or two cards. If you trash Treasures with this, this does not remove the 1 Coin you got from playing those Treasures this turn. For example, with 5 Coppers in play and two Buys, you could pay 3 Coins for a Bonfire to trash two of the Coppers, then spend the other 2 Coins on a Peasant.
244	en	Expedition	Evento		Draw 2 extra cards for your next hand.	 This increases the number of cards you draw in Clean- up of the same turn. It is cumulative. Normally you draw 5 cards; after an Expedition you would draw 7, after two Expeditions you would draw 9, and so on. It only applies for the turn you buy it. If you play Outpost (from Seaside), getting an extra turn with only 3 cards, and also buy Expedition, you add the 2 extra cards onto the base of 3 cards, for 5 cards total.
245	en	Ferry	Evento	Requiere: -2 Cost Token	Move your -<c>2</c> cost token to an Action Supply pile (cards from that pile cost <c>2</c> less on your turns, but not less than <c>0</c>.	 When you buy this, you move your - 2 Coin cost token to any Action Supply pile. This token makes cards from that pile cost 2 Coins less, but not less than 0 Coins, on your turns; see the Tokens section.
246	en	Plan	Evento	Requiere: Trash Token	Move your Trashing token to an Action Supply pile (when you buy a card from that pile, you may trash a card from your hand.)	 When you buy this, you move your Trashing token (the one depicting a tombstone) to any Action Supply pile. This token will let you trash a card from your hand when buying a card from that pile; see the Tokens section.
247	en	Mission	Evento		Once per turn: If the previous turn wasn't yours, take another turn after this one, in which you can't buy cards.	 You can only buy this once per turn. When you do, if the previous turn was not yours - if it was another player's turn before this turn - you take another turn after this turn ends. The extra turn is completely normal except that you cannot buy cards during it. You can still buy Events, and play cards, and gain cards in ways other than buying them (such as gaining a Silver from Amulet), and exchange Travelers. Buying Mission during a turn granted by Mission will not give you another turn, because the previous turn was yours.
248	en	Pilgrimage	Evento	Requiere: Journey Token	Once per turn: Turn your Journey token over (it starts face up); then if it's face up, choose up to 3 differently named cards you have in play and gain a copy of each.	 At the start of the game, place your Journey token (the one with the boot) face up. You can only buy this once per turn. When you do, turn your Journey token over. Then if it is face down, nothing more happens. If it is face up, choose up to 3 cards you have in play with different names and gain a copy of each. The copies you gain come from the Supply and are put into your discard pile. So, every other time you buy this, you will gain up to 3 cards. It does not matter what turned over the Journey token; you could turn it face down with Ranger, then face up with Pilgrimage.
249	en	Ball	Evento	Requiere: -1 Coin Token	Take your -<c>1</c> token. Gain 2 cards each costing up to <c>4</c>.	 When you buy this, you take your - 1 Coin token, which will cause you to get 1 Coin less the next time you get Coins. Then you gain 2 cards, each costing up 4 Coins. They can be 2 copies of the same card or 2 different cards.
250	en	Raid	Evento	Requiere: -1 Coin Token	Gain a Silver per Silver you have in play.<br/>Each other player puts his -1 Card token on his deck.	 This Event is like an Attack, but buying it is not playing an Attack, and so cannot be responded to with cards like Moat and Caravan Guard. When you buy this, you gain a Silver for each Silver you have in play; for example, with four Silvers in play, you would gain four Silvers. The Silvers go to your discard pile; if there aren't enough left, just take what is left. Then each other player puts his -1 Card token on top of his deck, which will cause those players to draw one less card the next time they draw cards; see the Tokens section.
251	en	Seaway	Evento	Requiere: +1 Buy Token	Gain an Action card costing up to <c>4</c>.<br/> Move your +1 Buy token to its pile (when you play a card from that pile, you first get +1 Buy).	 When you buy this, first you gain an Action card costing up to 4 Coins. The Action card comes from the Supply and is put into your discard pile. Then move your +1 Buy token to the pile the Action card came from. The token gives you +1 Buy when playing a card from that pile; see the Tokens section. It only matters how much the card costs that you gain; the cost is not checked later. For example you can play Bridge Troll, then use Seaway to gain a Bridge Troll (currently costing 4 Coins due to its own effect), and the token will stay there even when Bridge Troll costs 5 Coins later. You can use Seaway to gain Sir Martin (from Dark Ages) when he's on top of the Knights pile; then your +1 Buy token will be on the Knights pile, even though any remaining Knights will cost 5 Coins. You cannot use Seaway on an empty pile just to move the +1 Buy token; you have to pick a card you can gain.
252	en	Trade	Evento		Trash up to 2 cards from your hand.<br/>Gain a Silver per card you trashed.	 You may trash zero, one, or two cards from your hand. For each card you actually trashed, you gain a Silver, putting it into your discard pile.
253	en	Lost Arts	Evento	Requiere: +1 Action Token	Move your +1 Action token to an Action Supply pile (when you play a card from that pile, you first get +1 Action).	 When you buy this, you move your +1 Action token to any Action Supply pile. This token gives you +1 Action whenever you play a card from that pile; see the Tokens section.
254	en	Training	Evento	Requiere: +1 Coin Token	Move your +<c>1</c> token to an Action Supply pile (when you play a card from that pile, you first get +<c>1</c>).	 When you buy this, you move your + 1 Coin token to any Action Supply pile. This token gives you + 1 Coin whenever you play a card from that pile; see the Tokens section.
255	en	Inheritance	Evento	Requiere: Estate Token	Once per game: Set aside a non-Victory Action card from the Supply costing up to <c>4</c>. Move your Estate token to it (your Estates gain the abilities and types of that card).	 You can only buy this once per game. When you do, set aside a non-Victory Action card from the Supply that costs up to 4 Coins, and put your Estate token on it (the one depicting a house). This is not gaining a card, and does not count for things that care about gaining, such as Treasure Hunter; however at the end of the game, include the card in your deck when scoring. For the rest of the game, all of your Estates have the abilities and types of the set aside card. For example if you set aside a Port, then your Estates are Action - Victory cards, that can be played for +1 Card +2 Actions. This also changes Estates you buy or otherwise gain during the game; if you used Inheritance on a Port and then later bought an Estate, that Estate would come with a Port, just as buying a Port gains you a Port. This only affects your own Estates, not Estates of other players. An Estate is yours if either it started in your deck, or you gained it or bought it, or you were passed it with Masquerade (from Intrigue). An Estate stops being yours if you trash it, return it to the Supply, pass it with Masquerade, or are stopped from gaining it due to Possession (from Alchemy) or Trader (from Hinterlands). There are no limits on the set aside card other than being a non-Victory Action from the Supply costing up to 4 Coins; it may be a Duration card, a Reaction card, and so on. It does not have to continue costing up to 4 Coins, it only has to cost up to 4 Coins when set aside. Your Estates are still worth 1 Victory Point when scoring at the end of the game. Your Estates only copy abilities and types; they do not copy cost, name, or what pile they are from (thus they don't trigger tokens like +1 Action on the copied pile, and are not the Bane for Young Witch from Cornucopia even if the copied pile is the Bane). Starting Estates come from the Estates pile.
256	en	Pathfinding	Evento	Requiere: +1 Card Token	Move your +1 Card token to an Action Supply pile (when you play a card from that pile, you first get +1 Card).	 When you buy this, you move your +1 Card token to any Action Supply pile. This token gives you +1 Card whenever you play a card from that pile; see the Tokens section.
257	en	Summon	Evento		Gain an Action card costing up to <c>4</c>. Set it aside. If you do, then at the start of your next turn, play it.	Events are not Kingdom cards. In a player’s Buy phase, when the player can buy a card, the player can buy an Event instead. Buying an Event means paying the cost indicated on the Event and then doing the effect of the Event. The Event just stays on the table, the player does not take it; there is no way for a player to gain one or end up with one in his deck. Buying an Event uses up a Buy; normally a player can either buy a card, or buy an Event. A player with two Buys, such as after playing Ranger, could buy two cards, or buy two Events, or buy a card and an Event (in either order). The same Event can be bought multiple times in a turn if the player has the Buys and available to do it. Some Events give +Buys and so let the player buy further cards/Events afterwards. Players cannot play further Treasures that turn after buying an Event. Buying an Event is not buying a card and so does not trigger cards like Swamp Hag or Goons (from Prosperity). Costs of Events are not affected by cards like Bridge Troll.
